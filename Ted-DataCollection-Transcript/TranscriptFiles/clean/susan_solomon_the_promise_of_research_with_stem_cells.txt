model disease ability understand sick develop drug stem cell research child alzheimer's diabetes major disease view polio today preventable disease incredible field enormous hope humanity ivf 35 year ago birth healthy baby louise field siege politically financially critical research challenged supported essential private safe laboratory work advanced interference 2005 started york stem cell foundation laboratory small organization work support quickly world medical research developing drug treatment dominated expect large organization field large organization trouble can't question enormous gap that's larger academic research hand pharmaceutical company biotech responsible delivering drug treatment knew accelerate cure therapy address thing technology research model don't close gap today that's focus we've spent couple year pondering making list thing developed technology it's software hardware generate thousand thousand genetically diverse stem cell line create global array essentially avatar it's realize potential promise sequencing human genome it's clinical trial dish human cell animal cell generate drug treatment effective safer faster lower cost put perspective give context extremely field 1998 human embryonic stem cell identified year group scientist japan skin cell reprogram powerful virus create kind pluripotent stem cell called induced pluripotent stem cell

we're mouse can't living person illness pull brain cell cardiac cell start fooling lab test promising drug human stem cell create avatar create cell it's live motor neuron beating cardiac cell liver cell kind cell test drug promising compound actual cell you're affect it's absolutely extraordinary you're beginning early stage assay development testing you're wait 13 year you've brought drug market find doesn't work worse harm people isn't cell people small group people step back we've big picture room disease alzheimer's disease parkinson's disease affect differently disease parkinson's disease medication genetic makeup result drug worked wonderfully ineffective similarly drug harmful safe totally obvious pharmaceutical industry developing drug hasn't tool move size fit model we've

hand time take couple month scalable thing hand laboratory variation technique you're making drug aspirin you're bottle monday aspirin that's bottle wednesday looked thought artisanal wonderful clothing bread craft artisanal isn't work stem cell deal big hurdle brings back mapping human genome we're sequencing human genome it's shown a's c's g's t's make genetic code code dna zero computer code computer read it's app smartphone needed bringing biology incredible data find stand biological stand genetic information arrayed read create incredible avatar stem cell genetic type represent we've built it's automated robotic technology capacity produce thousand thousand stem cell line it's genetically arrayed massively parallel processing capability it's change drug discovered hope eventually what's happen we're screen drug array exist drug exist future you're taking drug treatment tested side effect relevant cell brain cell heart cell liver cell brought threshold personalized
