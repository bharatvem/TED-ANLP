special human brain study animal studying human brain brain interested question 10 year ago scientist thought knew brain made based evidence scientist thought mammalian brain including human brain made number neuron proportional size brain mean brain size respectable 400 gram similar number neuron neuron functional information processing unit brain owner brain similar cognitive ability chimp cow cow rich internal mental life smart choose realize eat people agree chimp capable complex elaborate flexible behavior cow indication brain made scenario play brain made compare animal brain size larger brain neuron smaller brain larger brain cognitively owner largest brain cognitively bad news brain largest vexing brain weighs 1 2 1 5 kilo elephant brain weigh kilo whale brain weigh kilo scientist resort brain special explain cognitive ability extraordinary exception rule bigger larger larger cerebral cortex size body give extra cortex interesting thing operating body size brain size body main reason brain larger comparing great ape gorilla time larger brain larger brain time larger gorilla brain human brain special amount energy weighs percent body 25 percent energy body requires run day 500 calorie total 2 000 calorie brain working human brain larger energy special story started bother biology rule apply animal life general rule evolution apply problem basic assumption brain made brain similar size made number neuron large brain necessarily neuron modest sized brain human brain neuron brain size cerebral cortex important question answer neuron human brain compare animal heard read 100 billion neuron 10 year ago asked colleague knew number digging literature original reference number find counted number neuron human brain brain matter count cell brain essentially consists dissolving brain soup work brain part brain dissolve detergent destroys cell membrane cell nucleus intact end suspension free nucleus clear soup soup nucleus mouse brain beauty soup soup agitate make nucleus distributed homogeneously liquid microscope sample homogeneous solution count nucleus cell brain simple straightforward fast method count neuron dozen specie turn brain made rodent primate instance larger rodent brain average size neuron increase brain inflates rapidly gain size faster gain neuron primate brain gain neuron average neuron larger economical add neuron brain result primate brain neuron rodent brain size larger brain larger difference brain found average 86 billion neuron 16 billion cerebral cortex cerebral cortex seat function awareness logical abstract reasoning 16 billion neuron cortex simplest explanation remarkable cognitive ability important 86 billion neuron found relationship size brain number neuron mathematically calculate human brain made rodent brain rodent brain 86 billion neuron weigh 36 kilo brain huge crushed weight impossible brain body 89 ton brings important conclusion rodent human brain large rat brain compared rat special fair comparison make rodent primate correct comparison primate math find generic primate 86 billion neuron brain 1 2 kilo body 66 kilo case brings unsurprising incredibly important conclusion primate primate darwin love darwin appreciated brain made image primate brain human brain remarkable special number neuron large primate brain humbling sobering thought remind place nature cost energy people figured energy human brain specie cost knew neuron brain made math turn human brain cost average calorie billion neuron day total energetic cost brain simple linear function number neuron turn human brain cost energy expect reason human brain cost energy simply huge number neuron primate neuron body size animal relative cost brain large primate special question remarkable number neuron great ape larger larger brain neuron realized expensive lot neuron brain figured simple reason afford energy large body large number neuron math calculated hand energy primate day eating raw food hand energy body size cost energy brain number neuron cost looked combination body size number brain neuron primate afford ate number hour day found neuron expensive tradeoff body size number neuron primate eats

orangutan instance afford 30 billion neuron spending half hour day eating hour feeding day practical limit primate 86 billion neuron 60 70 kilo body mass spend hour day single day feeding feasible ate primate brain cost energy spend waking hour day feeding alternative energy food remarkably match ancestor believed invented half million year ago invented cooking cook fire pre digest food body cooked food softer easier chew turn completely mush mouth completely digested absorbed gut make yield energy time cooking free time interesting thing day neuron thinking food food gobbling food day long cooking major liability large dangerously expensive brain lot neuron major asset afford energy lot neuron time interesting thing explains human brain grew large fast evolution remaining primate brain large brain affordable cooking rapidly raw food culture agriculture civilization grocery store electricity refrigerator thing nowadays energy day single sitting favorite fast food joint solution problem ironically solution raw food human advantage animal answer largest number neuron cerebral cortex simplest explanation remarkable cognitive ability animal fundamental reach large largest number
