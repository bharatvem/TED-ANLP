it's pleasure edinburgh scotland birthplace needle syringe mile direction 1853 scotsman filed patent needle syringe alexander wood royal college physician patent blow mind today identical needle today it's 160 year turn field vaccine vaccine delivered needle syringe 160 year technology credit it's due level vaccine successful technology clean water sanitation vaccine technology increased life span that's pretty hard act beat technology vaccine shortcoming needle syringe key part narrative technology let's start obvious don't needle syringe share view 20 percent population thing called needle phobia that's disliking needle actively avoiding vaccinated needle phobia that's problematic term rollout vaccine related key issue needlestick injury figure suggest 1 3 million death year place due cross contamination needlestick injury early death place thing heard shortcoming needle syringe heard holding back generation vaccine term immune response responsible problem cold chain i'll i'm work team australia university queensland technology designed tackle problem technology called nanopatch specimen nanopatch naked eye square smaller postage stamp microscope thousand tiny projection invisible human eye there's 4 000 projection square compared needle i've designed projection serve key role work skin's immune system that's important function tied nanopatch make nanopatch technique called deep reactive ion etching technique that's borrowed semiconductor industry low cost rolled large number dry coat vaccine projection nanopatch apply skin simplest form application finger finger limitation we've devised applicator it's simple device call sophisticated finger it's spring operated device apply nanopatch skin immediately thing happen firstly projection nanopatch breach tough outer layer vaccine quickly released minute fact nanopatch discard make reuse applicator idea nanopatch immediately key advantage we've talked needle free projection can't needle phobia issue step back important advantage improved immune response delivery rid cold chain let's start immunogenicity idea take head i'll explain simple term i'll step back explain vaccine work simple vaccine work introducing body thing called antigen safe form germ safe germ antigen trick body mounting immune response learning remembering deal intruder real intruder body quickly mount immune response deal vaccine neutralizes infection it's today needle syringe vaccine delivered technology needle argued needle holding back immune response it's missing immune sweet spot skin describe idea journey skin starting projection applying nanopatch skin kind data real data thing projection nanopatch that's applied skin color layer give idea scale needle shown big 10 time bigger size screen 10 time deeper it's grid immediately projection skin red layer tough outer layer dead skin brown layer magenta layer jammed full immune cell brown layer there's type cell called langerhans cell square millimeter body jammed full langerhans cell immune cell there's shown haven't stained image immediately nanopatch achieves penetration target thousand thousand cell residing hair's width surface skin guy that's invented thing designed found exciting you've targeted cell world vaccine world vaccine it's systematic don't vaccine work roll sleeve vaccinate wait it's gambler's game today gamble obtained influenza vaccine applied nanopatches applied nanopatches skin waited live animal waited month found data slide showing immune response we've generated nanopatch compared needle syringe muscle horizontal axis dose shown nanogram vertical axis immune response generated dashed line protection threshold we're line it's considered protective we're line it's red line curve there's point achieved needle that's protective that's high dose 6 000 nanogram notice immediately distinctly curve achieve blue line that's what's achieved nanopatch delivered dose nanopatch completely immunogenicity curve that's real fresh opportunity suddenly brand lever world vaccine push vaccine work expensive protection hundredth dose compared needle vaccine that's suddenly 10 dollar 10 cent that's important developing world there's angle vaccine don't work line protective world vaccine important let's big hiv malaria tuberculosis they're responsible 7 million death year adequate vaccination method potentially lever nanopatch make happen push lever candidate vaccine line we've worked lab vaccine attained similar response similar curve we've achieved influenza i'd switch talk key shortcoming today's vaccine maintain cold chain suggests cold chain it's requirement keeping vaccine production vaccine applied refrigerated present logistical challenge way slightly extreme case point help illustrate logistical challenge resource poor setting what's required vaccine refrigerated maintain cold chain vaccine warm vaccine break interestingly cold vaccine break stake high estimate africa half vaccine considered working properly point cold chain fallen it's big problem it's tied needle syringe it's liquid form vaccine it's liquid refrigeration key attribute nanopatch vaccine dry it's dry doesn't refrigeration lab we've shown vaccine stored 23 degree celsius year loss activity that's important improvement we're delighted thing proven nanopatch laboratory setting scientist love love science engineer biomedical engineer human i'm satisfied we've rolled thing lab people large number people we've commenced journey we've commenced journey unusual we've started papua guinea papua guinea developing world country it's size france suffers key barrier existing world today's vaccine there's logistics country 800 refrigerator vaccine chilled port moresby breaking highland required that's challenge papua guinea world's highest incidence hpv human papillomavirus cervical cancer risk factor vaccine large number it's expensive reason attribute nanopatch we've field worked nanopatch papua guinea we'll shortly kind work easy it's challenging there's world i'd ahead i'd share thought it's thought future 17 million death year due infectious disease historical footnote it's historical footnote achieved improved radically improved vaccine standing today front birthplace needle syringe device that's 160 year i'm presenting alternative approach make happen it's nanopatch attribute needle free pain free ability removing cold chain improving immunogenicity
