pleasure edinburgh scotland birthplace needle syringe mile direction 1853 scotsman filed patent needle syringe alexander wood royal college physician patent blow mind today identical needle today 160 year turn field vaccine vaccine delivered needle syringe 160 year technology credit due level vaccine successful technology clean water sanitation vaccine technology increased life span pretty hard act beat technology vaccine shortcoming needle syringe key part narrative technology start obvious needle syringe share view 20 percent population thing called needle phobia disliking needle actively avoiding vaccinated needle phobia problematic term rollout vaccine related key issue needlestick injury figure suggest 1 3 million death year place due cross contamination needlestick injury early death place thing heard shortcoming needle syringe heard holding back generation vaccine term immune response responsible problem cold chain work team australia university queensland technology designed tackle problem technology called nanopatch specimen nanopatch naked eye square smaller postage stamp microscope thousand tiny projection invisible human eye 4 000 projection square compared needle designed projection serve key role work skin immune system important function tied nanopatch make nanopatch technique called deep reactive ion etching technique borrowed semiconductor industry low cost rolled large number dry coat vaccine projection nanopatch apply skin simplest form application finger finger limitation devised applicator simple device call sophisticated finger spring operated device apply nanopatch skin immediately thing happen firstly projection nanopatch breach tough outer layer vaccine quickly released minute fact nanopatch discard make reuse applicator idea nanopatch immediately key advantage talked needle free projection needle phobia issue step back important advantage improved immune response delivery rid cold chain start immunogenicity idea take head explain simple term step back explain vaccine work simple vaccine work introducing body thing called antigen safe form germ safe germ antigen trick body mounting immune response learning remembering deal intruder real intruder body quickly mount immune response deal vaccine neutralizes infection today needle syringe vaccine delivered technology needle argued needle holding back immune response missing immune sweet spot skin describe idea journey skin starting projection applying nanopatch skin kind data real data thing projection nanopatch applied skin color layer give idea scale needle shown big 10 time bigger size screen 10 time deeper grid immediately projection skin red layer tough outer layer dead skin brown layer magenta layer jammed full immune cell brown layer type cell called langerhans cell square millimeter body jammed full langerhans cell immune cell shown stained image immediately nanopatch achieves penetration target thousand thousand cell residing hair width surface skin guy invented thing designed found exciting targeted cell world vaccine world vaccine systematic vaccine work roll sleeve vaccinate wait gambler game today gamble obtained influenza vaccine applied nanopatches applied nanopatches skin waited live animal waited month found data slide showing immune response generated nanopatch compared needle syringe muscle horizontal axis dose shown nanogram vertical axis immune response generated dashed line protection threshold line considered protective line red line curve point achieved needle protective high dose 6 000 nanogram notice immediately distinctly curve achieve blue line achieved nanopatch delivered dose nanopatch completely immunogenicity curve real fresh opportunity suddenly brand lever world vaccine push vaccine work expensive protection hundredth dose compared needle vaccine suddenly 10 dollar 10 cent important developing world angle vaccine work line protective world vaccine important big hiv malaria tuberculosis responsible 7 million death year adequate vaccination method potentially lever nanopatch make happen push lever candidate vaccine line worked lab vaccine attained similar response similar curve achieved influenza switch talk key shortcoming today vaccine maintain cold chain suggests cold chain requirement keeping vaccine production vaccine applied refrigerated present logistical challenge way slightly extreme case point help illustrate logistical challenge resource poor setting required vaccine refrigerated maintain cold chain vaccine warm vaccine break interestingly cold vaccine break stake high estimate africa half vaccine considered working properly point cold chain fallen big problem tied needle syringe liquid form vaccine liquid refrigeration key attribute nanopatch vaccine dry dry refrigeration lab shown vaccine stored 23 degree celsius year loss activity important improvement delighted thing proven nanopatch laboratory setting scientist love love science engineer biomedical engineer human satisfied rolled thing lab people large number people commenced journey commenced journey unusual started papua guinea papua guinea developing world country size france suffers key barrier existing world today vaccine logistics country 800 refrigerator vaccine chilled port moresby breaking highland required challenge papua guinea world highest incidence hpv human papillomavirus cervical cancer risk factor vaccine large number expensive reason attribute nanopatch field worked nanopatch papua guinea shortly kind work easy challenging world ahead share thought thought future 17 million death year due infectious disease historical footnote historical footnote achieved improved radically improved vaccine standing today front birthplace needle syringe device 160 year presenting alternative approach make happen nanopatch attribute needle free pain free ability removing cold chain improving immunogenicity
