phenomenon moment called quantum levitation quantum locking object levitating called superconductor superconductivity quantum state matter occurs critical temperature it's phenomenon discovered 100 year ago recently due technological advancement demonstrate quantum levitation quantum locking superconductor defined property electrical resistance expulsion magnetic field interior superconductor sound complicated electrical resistance electricity flow electron inside material electron flowing collide atom collision lose amount energy dissipate energy form heat effect inside superconductor collision energy dissipation it's remarkable classical physic friction energy loss quantum effect that's superconductors don't magnetic field superconductor expel magnetic field inside mean circulating current combination effect expulsion magnetic field electrical resistance superconductor picture isn't perfect strand magnetic field remain inside superconductor proper condition strand magnetic field trapped inside superconductor strand magnetic field inside superconductor discrete quantity quantum phenomenon it's quantum physic turn behave quantum particle movie flow discretely strand magnetic field particle behave particle call effect quantum levitation quantum locking superconductor put inside magnetic field strand magnetic field left inside superconductor doesn't moving movement dissipate energy break superconductivity state lock strand called fluxons lock fluxons place locking place movement superconductor change place change configuration quantum locking show work superconductor wrapped it'd stay cold long place top regular magnet stay locked midair levitation it's repulsion rearrange fluxons locked configuration move slightly left quantum locking locking dimensional locking superconductor turn upside remain locked understand called levitation locking yeah understand won't surprised hear circular magnet magnetic field superconductor freely rotate axis magnet long rotates locking maintained adjust rotate superconductor frictionless motion levitating move freely quantum locking levitate top magnet fluxons magnetic strand single disk calculate turn lot hundred billion strand magnetic field inside inch disk that's amazing part haven't told yeah amazing part superconductor half micron thick it's extremely thin extremely thin layer levitate 70 000 time weight it's remarkable effect it's strong extend circular magnet make track make large circular rail place superconducting disk top rail move freely that's adjust position rotate freely move position thing let's time disk put stay don't move rotate track correctly stay suspended it's quantum locking levitation i'll circulate bit superconductors transfer enormous amount current inside superconductors produce strong magnetic field needed mri machine particle accelerator store energy superconductors dissipation produce power cable transfer enormous amount current power station imagine back single power station single superconducting cable future quantum levitation quantum locking answer simple question giving imagine disk similar hand inch diameter single difference superconducting layer half micron thin millimeter thin thin millimeter thin superconducting layer hold 1 000 kilogram small car hand amazing
