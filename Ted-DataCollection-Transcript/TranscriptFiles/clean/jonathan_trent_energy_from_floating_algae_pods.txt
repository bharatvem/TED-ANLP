year ago set understand possibility develop biofuels scale compete fossil fuel compete agriculture water fertilizer land imagine build enclosure put underwater fill wastewater form microalgae produce oil make kind flexible material move wave underwater system build solar energy grow algae co2 good produce oxygen grow algae grow container distributes heat surrounding water harvest make biofuels cosmetic fertilizer animal feed make large area worry stakeholder fisherman ship thing hey talking biofuels importance potentially alternative liquid fuel talking microalgae graph showing type crop considered making biofuels thing soybean make 50 gallon acre year sunflower canola jatropha palm tall graph show microalgae contribute microalgae contributes 2 000 5 000 gallon acre year compared 50 gallon acre year soy microalgae microalgae micro extremely small picture single celled organism compared human hair small organism million year thousand specie microalgae world fastest growing plant planet produce showed lot lot oil offshore reason offshore coastal city choice waste water suggested waste water treatment plant embedded city city san francisco 900 mile sewer pipe city release waste water offshore city world treat waste water differently city process city release water case water released perfectly adequate growing microalgae envision system call omega acronym offshore membrane enclosure growing algae nasa good acronym work sort showed work put waste water source co2 floating structure waste water nutrient algae grow sequester co2 atmosphere greenhouse gas solar energy grow wave energy surface energy mixing algae temperature controlled surrounding water temperature algae grow produce oxygen mentioned produce biofuels fertilizer food bi algal product interest system

plastic building tool making lot mistake edison finding 10 000 way system work grew algae waste water built tool allowed life algae monitor grow make happy make culture survive thrive important feature needed develop called photobioreactors pbrs structure floating surface made inexpensive plastic material algae grow built lot lot design horrible failure finally design worked 30 gallon scaled

putting head plastic bag algae suffocate co2 suffocate produce oxygen suffocate oxygen produce problematic co2 thing figure remove oxygen building column circulated water put back co2 bubbling system recirculated water prototype attempt building type column larger column installed san francisco installed system column nice feature algae settle column allowed accumulate algal biomass context easily harvest remove algae concentrated bottom column harvest procedure float algae surface skim net wanted investigate impact system marine environment mentioned set experiment field site moss landing marine lab found material overgrown algae needed develop cleaning procedure looked seabird marine mammal interacted fact sea otter found incredibly interesting periodically work floating water bed wanted hire guy train clean surface thing future working area research covered biology system included studying algae grew eats algae kill algae engineering understand build structure small scale
