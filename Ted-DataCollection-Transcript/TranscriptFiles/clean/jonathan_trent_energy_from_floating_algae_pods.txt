year ago set understand possibility develop biofuels scale compete fossil fuel compete agriculture water fertilizer land here's imagine build enclosure put underwater fill wastewater form microalgae produce oil make kind flexible material move wave underwater system we're build solar energy grow algae co2 good produce oxygen grow algae grow container distributes heat surrounding water harvest make biofuels cosmetic fertilizer animal feed you'd make large area you'd worry stakeholder fisherman ship thing hey we're talking biofuels importance potentially alternative liquid fuel talking microalgae graph showing type crop considered making biofuels thing soybean make 50 gallon acre year sunflower canola jatropha palm tall graph show microalgae contribute microalgae contributes 2 000 5 000 gallon acre year compared 50 gallon acre year soy microalgae microalgae micro they're extremely small picture single celled organism compared human hair small organism million year there's thousand specie microalgae world fastest growing plant planet produce showed lot lot oil offshore reason we're offshore coastal city isn't choice we're waste water suggested waste water treatment plant they're embedded city city san francisco 900 mile sewer pipe city release waste water offshore city world treat waste water differently city process city release water case water that's released perfectly adequate growing microalgae let's envision system call omega acronym offshore membrane enclosure growing algae nasa good acronym work sort showed work put waste water source co2 floating structure waste water nutrient algae grow sequester co2 atmosphere greenhouse gas solar energy grow wave energy surface energy mixing algae temperature controlled surrounding water temperature algae grow produce oxygen i've mentioned produce biofuels fertilizer food bi algal product interest system contained it's modular let's that's totally unexpected module leak it's struck lightning waste water leak water coastal environment algae leak biodegradable they're living waste water they're fresh water algae mean can't live salt water die plastic we'll build kind plastic good experience we'll rebuild module reuse thinking system i'm showing term water fresh water issue future we're working method recovering waste water thing structure surface thing ocean surface covered seaweed organism ocean enhanced marine habitat increase biodiversity finally it's offshore structure term contribute aquaculture activity offshore you're thinking gee sound good idea it's real set laboratory santa cruz california fish game facility facility allowed big seawater tank test idea set experiment san francisco waste water treatment plant facility test idea finally wanted impact structure marine environment set field site place called moss landing marine lab monterey bay worked harbor impact marine organism laboratory set santa cruz skunkworks place growing algae welding plastic building tool making lot mistake edison finding 10 000 way system wouldn't work grew algae waste water built tool allowed life algae monitor grow make happy make we're culture survive thrive important feature needed develop called photobioreactors pbrs structure floating surface made inexpensive plastic material that'll algae grow built lot lot design horrible failure finally design worked 30 gallon scaled 450 gallon san francisco show system work basically waste water algae choice circulate floating structure tubular flexible plastic structure circulates thing there's sunlight it's surface algae grow nutrient bit putting head plastic bag algae suffocate co2 suffocate produce oxygen don't suffocate oxygen produce problematic co2 thing figure remove oxygen building column circulated water put back co2 bubbling system recirculated water prototype attempt building type column larger column installed san francisco installed system column nice feature algae settle column allowed accumulate algal biomass context easily harvest remove algae concentrated bottom column harvest procedure float algae surface skim net wanted investigate impact system marine environment mentioned set experiment field site moss landing marine lab found material overgrown algae needed develop cleaning procedure looked seabird marine mammal interacted fact sea otter found incredibly interesting periodically work floating water bed wanted hire guy train clean surface thing that's future working area research covered biology system included studying algae grew eats algae kill algae engineering understand build structure small scale build enormous scale ultimately required mentioned looked bird marine mammal looked basically environmental impact system finally looked economics economics energy required run system energy system put system make system run operating cost capital cost economic structure it's easy there's lot work area make system work don't lot time i'd show artist's conception system find protected bay world background image waste water treatment plant source flue gas co2 economics system find fact difficult make work system treat waste water sequester carbon potentially photovoltaic panel wave energy wind energy start thinking term integrating activity include facility aquaculture system shellfish aquaculture we're growing mussel scallop we'd growing oyster thing producing high product food market driver build system larger larger scale ultimately competitive idea fuel there's big question plastic ocean bad reputation we've thinking cradle cradle plastic we're marine environment don't california there's huge amount plastic that's field plastic mulch plastic that's making tiny greenhouse surface soil warming soil increase growing season control weed make watering efficient omega system part type outcome we're finished marine environment we'll field put offshore here's image san francisco bay san francisco produce 65 million gallon day waste water imagine day retention time system we'd 325 million gallon accomodate 1 280 acre omega module floating san francisco bay that's percent surface area bay produce 2 000 gallon acre year produce 2 million gallon fuel 20 percent biodiesel diesel required san francisco that's efficiency potentially put system there's lot possibility there's san francisco bay mentioned san diego bay mobile bay chesapeake bay reality sea level rise there's lot lot opportunity i'm telling system integrated activity biofuels production integrated alternative energy integrated aquaculture set find pathway innovative production sustainable biofuels en route discovered what's required sustainability integration innovation long term great faith collective connected ingenuity limit accomplish radically open don't care credit sustainable solution future problem diverse alpha omega chris anderson quick question jonathan project continue move forward nasa ambitious green energy fund throat jonathan trent it's stage nasa spin offshore lot issue united state limited permitting issue time required permit thing offshore requires point people we're radically open technology we're launch who's interested make real ca that's interesting you're patenting you're publishing jt absolutely ca jt
