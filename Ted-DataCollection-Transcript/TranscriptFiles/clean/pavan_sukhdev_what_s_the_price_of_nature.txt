i'm talk economic invisibility nature bad news mother nature's back office isn't working invoice don't issued problem began life market professional continued interest recent effort human being nature doesn't priced market project called teeb started 2007 launched group environment minister g8 5 basic inspiration stern review lord stern asked question economics make convincing case early action climate change can't conservation can't equivalent case made nature answer yeah it's straightforward biodiversity living fabric planet gas exists layer ecosystem specie gene scale international national local community nature lord stern team nature easy began began project interim report quickly pulled lot information collected subject researcher compiled result startling revelation fact losing natural capital benefit flow nature losing extraordinary rate fact order trillion dollar worth natural capital 2008 time banking crisis shown lost financial capital order half trillion dollar comparable size kind loss present international community government local government business people slew report presented u n year address economic invisibility nature describe solve picture you're familiar amazon rainforest it's massive store carbon it's amazing store biodiversity people don't rain factory northeastern trade wind amazona effectively gather water vapor 20 billion ton day water vapor sucked northeastern trade wind eventually precipitate form rain la plata basin rainfall cycle rainfall factory effectively feed agricultural economy order 240 billion dollar worth latin america question arises uruguay paraguay argentina state mato grosso brazil pay vital input economy state amazona produce rainfall answer zilch that's economic invisibility nature can't economic incentive disincentive powerful economics currency policy address invisibility result gradual degradation loss valuable natural asset it's amazona rainforest matter level it's ecosystem level specie level

15 percent country measure they're worth poor answer 45 percent 75 percent 90 percent that's difference important benefit poor can't proper model development time you're destroying allowing degradation asset important asset development asset ecological infrastructure bad thing picture called specie abundance it's basically measure tiger toad tick average biomass specie green represents percentage start green it's 80 100 percent it's yellow it's 40 60 percent percentage versus original state speak pre industrial era 1750 i'm show business usual affect watch change color india china europe saharan africa move consume global biomass rate sustain place remain green that's good news fact place gobi desert tundra sahara doesn't specie volume biomass place challenge reason happening boil mind basic problem inability perceive difference public benefit private profit tend constantly ignore public wealth simply common wealth it's common good here's thailand found mangrove it's 600 life year measured compared shrimp farm 9 600 gradual trend deplete mangrove convert shrimp farm profit 8 000 dollar fact subsidy compare side coin find it's 1 200 600 that's hard hand start measuring cost restore land shrimp farm back productive salt deposition chemical deposition effect answer 12 000 cost benefit mangrove term storm protection cyclone protection term fishery fish nursery provide

green carbon market teeb dozen separate group solution including protected area evaluation payment ecosystem service eco certification favorite what's green carbon today basically brown carbon marketplace it's energy emission european union ets main marketplace it's we've issued bit inflation issue currency declining price that's energy industry we're missing emission black carbon soot we're missing blue carbon largest store carbon 55 percent thankfully flux word flow emission ocean atmosphere vice versa balanced fact what's absorbed 25 percent emission lead acidification lower alkalinity ocean minute finally there's deforestation there's emission methane agriculture green carbon deforestation agricultural emission blue carbon comprise 25 percent emission mean hand structure mechanism called redd scheme reduced emission deforestation forest degradation norway contributed billion dollar indonesia brazil implement red scheme movement forward thing lot solve problem
