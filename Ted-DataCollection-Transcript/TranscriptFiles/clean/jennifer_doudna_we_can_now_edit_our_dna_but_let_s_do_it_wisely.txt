year ago colleague emmanuelle charpentier invented technology editing genome called crispr cas9 crispr technology scientist make dna cell cure genetic disease interested crispr technology basic research project aimed discovering bacteria fight viral infection bacteria deal virus environment viral infection ticking time bomb bacterium minute defuse bomb destroyed bacteria cell adaptive immune system called crispr detect viral dna destroy part crispr system protein called cas9 seek cut eventually degrade viral dna specific research understand activity protein cas9 realized harness function genetic engineering technology scientist delete insert specific bit dna cell incredible precision offer opportunity thing past crispr technology change dna cell mouse monkey organism chinese scientist showed recently crispr technology change gene human embryo scientist philadelphia showed crispr remove dna integrated hiv virus infected human cell opportunity kind genome editing raise ethical issue technology employed adult cell embryo organism including specie colleague called global conversation technology invented ethical societal implication technology crispr technology today prudent path forward employ technology virus infect cell inject dna bacterium crispr system dna plucked virus inserted bit chromosome dna bacterium integrated bit viral dna inserted site called crispr crispr stand clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat big mouthful acronym crispr mechanism cell record time virus exposed importantly bit dna passed cell progeny cell protected virus generation generation cell cell record infection colleague blake wiedenheft like crispr locus effectively genetic vaccination card cell bit dna inserted bacterial chromosome cell make copy molecule called rna orange picture exact replicate viral dna rna chemical cousin dna interaction dna molecule matching sequence bit rna crispr locus associate bind protein called cas9 white picture form complex function sentinel cell search dna cell find site match sequence bound rna site found blue molecule dna complex associate dna cas9 cleaver cut viral dna make precise break cas9 rna sentinel complex pair scissors cut dna make double stranded break dna helix importantly complex programmable programmed recognize dna sequence make break dna site recognized activity harnessed genome engineering cell make precise change dna site break introduced sort analogous word processing program fix typo document reason envisioned crispr system genome engineering cell ability detect broken dna repair plant animal cell detects double stranded break dna fix break pasting end broken dna tiny change sequence position repair break integrating piece dna site cut introduce double stranded break dna precise place trigger cell repair break disruption incorporation genetic information program crispr technology make break dna position mutation causing cystic fibrosis trigger cell repair mutation genome engineering development 1970s technology sequencing dna copying dna manipulating dna technology promising problem inefficient difficult scientist adopted laboratory clinical application opportunity technology crispr utilize appeal relative simplicity older genome engineering technology similar rewire computer time run piece software crispr technology software genome program easily bit rna double stranded break made dna induce repair potentially achieve astounding thing correct mutation sickle cell anemia huntington disease application crispr technology happen blood easier deliver tool cell compared solid tissue lot work applies animal model human disease mouse technology make precise study cell dna affect tissue case entire organism crispr technology disrupt gene making tiny change dna gene responsible black coat color mouse imagine white mouse differ pigmented litter mate tiny change gene entire genome completely normal sequence dna animal find change dna occurred place induced crispr technology additional experiment animal creating model human disease monkey find system test application technology tissue figuring deliver crispr tool cell understand control dna repaired cut figure control limit kind target unintended effect technology clinical application technology adult 10 year clinical trial possibly approved therapy time exciting thing excitement technology lot interest start company founded commercialize crispr technology lot venture capitalist investing company crispr technology thing enhancement imagine engineer human enhanced property stronger bone susceptibility cardiovascular disease property desirable eye color taller thing designer human genetic information understand type gene give rise trait important crispr technology tool make knowledge raise number ethical question carefully colleague called global pause clinical application crispr technology human embryo give time implication important precedent pause 1970s scientist call moratorium molecular cloning safety technology tested carefully validated genome engineered human longer science fiction genome engineered animal plant happening put front huge responsibility carefully unintended consequence intended impact scientific breakthrough bruno giussani jennifer technology huge consequence pointed attitude pause moratorium quarantine incredibly responsible therapeutic result therapeutic gaining traction medium latest issue economist editing humanity genetic enhancement therapeutic kind reaction back march colleague science world asked suggested pause moment jennifer doudna colleague delighted opportunity discus openly interesting talk people scientific colleague wide variety viewpoint topic careful consideration discussion bg big meeting happening december colleague calling national academy science hope meeting practically jd hope air view individual stakeholder technology responsibly consensus point view understand issue forward bg colleague george church harvard yeah ethical issue basically question safety test test test animal lab feel safe move human kind school thought opportunity split happening science community people holding back ethical concern forward country regulate regulate jd technology variety viewpoint perfectly understandable end technology human genome engineering careful consideration discussion risk potential complication responsible bg lot technology field science developing exponentially pretty thinking artificial intelligence autonomous robot autonomous warfare robot launched similar discussion field calling moratorium discussion serve blueprint field jd hard scientist laboratory speaking bit uncomfortable involved genesis put colleague position responsibility hope technology considered implication field biology bg jennifer coming ted jd
