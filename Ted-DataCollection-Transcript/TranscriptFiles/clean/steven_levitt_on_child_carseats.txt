turned complicated expensive cure treatment child turned started cheap easy treatment wondered parent lose child isn't complicated expensive cure told people possibly that's cheap simple work that's complicated expensive people thought you're wrong thing switch cheap simple solution government heard story people yeah you're make law outlaw cheap simple treatment child people happy satisfied year fine lowly economist child expensive complicated treatment knew cheap simple thought expensive didn't great thought don't science data data expensive complicated treatment work cheap simple lo behold data found didn't expensive complicated solution cheap child older cheap didn't work kid younger people i've made wonderful finding cheap simple solution save 300 million dollar year spend child way parent unhappy terrible thing cheap easy thing good hard thing government upset people made expensive solution upset thought hope compete that's essentially free lose market people angry called horrible name decided leave country day seek intelligent open minded people place called oxford story place it's fairy tale it's true story united state today disease i'm referring motor vehicle accident child free cure adult seatbelt expensive cure 300 million dollar year cure child car seat i'd talk today evidence true child year real benefit proven benefit car seat spite incredible energy devoted expanding law making socially unacceptable put child seatbelt talk make true finally talk bit technology hasn't enthusiasm adoption precisely people enamored current car seat solution time research data record complicated story it's hard find data doesn't turn case seatbelt versus car seat united state data set fatal accident that's happened 1975 car crash person dy information people data it's national highway transportation safety administration's website raw data begin sense limited amount evidence that's favor car seat child aged data year old basically car seat can't compare 29 3 percent child unrestrained crash person dy die put child car seat 18 2 percent child die they're wearing lap shoulder belt raw data 19 4 percent die interestingly wearing lap seatbelt 16 7 percent die theory tell lap seatbelt's worse lap shoulder belt reminds deal raw data hundred confounding variable study presenting information turned figure make easier yellow bar represents car seat orange bar lap shoulder red bar lap seatbelt relative unrestrained bigger bar data showed highest bar you're striving beat control basic thing hard crash seat child sitting age child that's middle set bar lap seatbelt start worse finally set bar controlling possibly imagine crash 50 75 100 characteristic crash find car seat lap shoulder belt saving life fatality identical standard error band small estimate it's it's robust thing that's interesting frontal impact crash car crash front hit car seat bit isn't chance order car seat approved pas federal standard involve slamming car direct frontal crash type crash rear impact crash car seat don't perform that's they've optimized pas expect people optimize relative bright line rule affected car thing argue car seat lot time recent crash data set 30 years' worth data won't recent crash car seat recent crash lap shoulder seatbelt car seat that's impossible can't line argument parent car seat expensive complicated big tangle latch possibly work seatbelt expensive complicated it's kind interesting logic people logic government wouldn't told weren't what's interesting government telling based based impassioned plea parent child died turned led passage law data telling story abstract statistic friend dinner cookout advice proving point don't run crash test that's great idea commission crash test turn called independent crash test company country wanted crash test explicitly explicitly business car seat manufacturer can't risk alienating testing seatbelt relative car seat eventually condition anonymity happy test anonymity 1 500 dollar

seat wrong putting child risk it's fundamentally car seat aren't here's crash timed time take longer car seat rebound take lot longer there's lot movement child who's seatbelt i'll show year crash year car seat turn terrible that's great that's 400 kid fine crash problematic child here's year seatbelt fact point year car seat absolutely whatsoever that's evidence sense criticized scientist publish study n 4 meaning crash wrote back n 45 004 45 000 real world crash it's interesting idea real world crash economist thing scientist don't laboratory imperfect science dummy 30 year data we've child car seat answer puzzle there's solution that's excited delighted car seat working design perspective back square protect kid back seat don't there's room who'd start let's make great seat belt adult let's make big contraption rig daisy chain start who's sitting back seat kid essentially don't cost there's reason expensive regular car seat it's folding it's seat you've regular seat adult fold kid sits top it's integrated can't expensive solution it's work question hope adoption save lot life answer lie story answer car seat successful someday adopted lie story dad told relating doctor

we're stuck conventional car seat long time (audience wanted wear seatbelt don't necessarily wear prevent loss life it's prevent lot injury data fatality doesn't injury data show child seat effective effective seatbelt injury prove case ) steven levitt yeah that's great question data data set i've looked jersey crash find small difference injury data it's statistically insignificant difference injury car seat lap shoulder belt jersey data it's fatal crash crash jersey reported turn 10 percent difference injury generally they're minor injury what's interesting disclaimer medical literature difficult resolve data suggests car seat dramatically completely methodology involves crash occurs insurance company name people crash call phone asked happened can't resolve i'd work medical researcher understand difference completely odds it's critical question question injury make cost effective it's kind tricky they're it's clear they're cost effective
