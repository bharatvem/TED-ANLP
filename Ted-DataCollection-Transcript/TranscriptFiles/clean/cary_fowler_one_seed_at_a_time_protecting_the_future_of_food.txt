i've fascinated crop diversity 35 year stumbled fairly obscure academic article guy named jack harlan diversity crop kind wheat rice genetic resource genetic resource i'll forget word stand catastrophic starvation scale imagine figured academic nutcase looked figured wasn't nutcase respected scientist field understood biological diversity crop diversity biological foundation agriculture it's raw material stuff evolution agricultural crop trivial matter understood foundation crumbling literally crumbling mass extinction underway field agricultural system mass extinction taking place people noticing fewer caring don't stop diversity agricultural system let's face that's logical don't newspaper day supermarket don't lot choice apple red yellow green that's show picture form
