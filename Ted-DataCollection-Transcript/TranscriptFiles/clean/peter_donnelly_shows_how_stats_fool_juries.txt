speaker it's daunting experience daunting experience speaking front audience unlike speaker i'm mystery universe wonder evolution clever innovative way people attacking major inequality world challenge nation state modern global economy you've heard statistic precise exciting thing statistic that's that's challenging speaker coming senior colleague told youngster profession proudly statistician people figure didn't personality skill accountant there's joke statistician that's introverted statistician extroverted statistician answer extroverted statistician's person's shoe concentrate evening there's reception university's museum natural history it's wonderful setting hope you'll find great icon victorian tradition it's special setting collection people find talking you'd weren't here's i'm statistician they've pre warned they'll you're making thing happen they'll discover long lost cousin corner room run talk they'll suddenly parched hungry sprint drink food you'll left peace talk person talk it's challenge profession explain we're top people's list dinner party guest conversation it's i've found good wife girlfriend managed i've year ago started working bbc britain stage working america coming back visit told colleague boyfriend sarah thought hard thing i'd explained concentrated day listening don't thinking work developing mathematical model understanding evolution modern genetics colleague paused model thing colleague suddenly interested expect model sarah thought bit work gene model gene love that's i'll bit generally thinking place uncertainty randomness chance world react don't you've pretty easy time till laugh kind thing talk date you've i'm question here's scene question i'm imagine tossing coin successively reason remain vague we're interested pattern here's head tail tail suppose toss coin repeatedly pattern head tail tail we've suddenly fixated count 10 10th toss interesting thing humor moment imagine half audience coin toss pattern head tail tail time 10th toss time it's fourth toss time 15th toss lot lot time average number that's side half audience doesn't head tail tail deep cultural reason that's boring they're interested pattern head tail head side coin toss toss toss count number time pattern head tail head appears average side you've number you've lot time accurately average number toss head tail tail side you've number average number toss head tail head here's deep mathematical fact you've number thing true they're one's bigger one's bigger what's you've you've vote we're moving don't end minute silence give time everyone's expressed view compare average number toss head tail head average number toss head tail tail think true average it'll longer head tail head head tail tail think b true average they're think true average it'll time head tail head head tail tail hasn't voted that's naughty people b true relieved distinguished mathematician it's true take longer average fact average number toss till head tail head 10 average number toss head tail tail pattern head tail head overlap head tail head tail head cunningly occurrence pattern toss can't head tail tail turn important way thinking i'll give imagine let's suppose we're side remember you're excited head tail tail you're excited head tail head start tossing coin head start sitting edge seat great wonderful awesome happen toss tail excited champagne's ice you've glass chilled celebrate you're waiting bated breath final toss head that's great you're celebrate it's tail disappointedly put glass put champagne back tossing wait head excited side there's experience it's part sequence you're bit excited head excited tail toss coin it's tail crack open champagne it's head you're disappointed you're pattern that's informal presenting that's there's difference thinking tossed coin million time we'd expect million head tail head million head tail tail head tail head occur clump put million thing million position overlapping clump it's intuition what's point make it's simple easily stated question probability you're good company wrong diversion real passion genetics there's connection head tail head head tail tail genetics it's toss coin sequence head tail dna there's sequence thing head tail letter g c t chemical scissors called restriction enzyme cut dna pattern they're enormously tool modern molecular biology question long head tail head big chunk restriction enzyme cut see g g long chunk that's trivial connection probability genetics there's deeper connection don't time modern genetics exciting area science we'll hear talk conference specifically turn unlocking secret information generated modern experimental technology key part fairly sophisticated you'll relieved day job sophisticated head tail head story sophisticated computer modeling mathematical modeling modern statistical technique give snippet example project we're involved group oxford exciting human genome project project aimed read copy human genome natural thing you've that's project international hapmap project collaboration lab country human genome project learning we've common hapmap project

understand genetics understand genetic difference disease understand human disease don't bottom understand genetics we'll window disease work thinking disease therapy preventative treatment that's diversion main love back mundane issue thinking uncertainty here's quiz suppose we've test disease isn't infallible it's pretty good 99 percent time street test disease question let's suppose there's test hiv virus aid test person disease what's chance test 99 percent time natural answer 99 percent like answer everyone's involved don't don't trust anymore you're bit skeptical that's answer that's it's answer it's it's part story depends common rare disease illustrate here's caricature million individual let's disease affect it's pretty rare affect person 10 000 million individual healthy disease fact prevalence disease 100 disease rest won't suppose test 100 disease test 99 percent time 99 test positive people don't disease test 99 percent time it'll wrong percent time there'll enormous number false positive put test positive individual involved 100 disease test accurate important part story there's bit information here's key intuition test positive weigh plausibility likelihood competing explanation explanation bit bit explanation person doesn't disease that's overwhelmingly pick random test wrong explanation person disease that's test number end number bit 100 explanation relative here's topical thing britain what's celebrated case woman called sally clark baby died suddenly initially thought died what's informally cot death formally sudden infant death syndrome reason charged murder trial trial distinguished pediatrician gave evidence chance cot death innocent death family professional smoking 73 million cut long story short convicted time fairly recently acquitted appeal fact appeal set context imagine awful lost child they're innocent convicted murdering put stress trial convicted murdering spend time women's prison prisoner killed child awful thing happen happened large part expert statistic horribly wrong way 73 million number looked research chance cot death family sally clark's 8 500 i'll assume cot death family chance child dying cot death aren't changed that's statistician call assumption independence it's toss coin head time won't affect chance head time toss coin chance head half that's chance time time half chance time i'll assume event independent multiply 8 500 73 million stated court assumption presented jury regrettably situation you'd verify empirically it's palpably false lot lot thing don't sudden infant death environmental factor we're aware it's pretty case genetic factor we're aware family suffers cot death you'd put high risk group they've environmental risk factor genetic risk factor don't argue chance death didn't information silly it's worse silly it's bad science nonetheless that's presented trial argued that's problem problem number 73 million sally clark convicted imagine made splash press journalist britain's reputable newspaper wrote expert chance innocent 73 million that's logical error it's logical error logical error thinking disease test 99 percent accurate chance disease 99 percent disease bear mind thing possibility test chance priori person disease it's context thing involved part explanation explanation sally clark innocent priori overwhelmingly mother don't kill child part explanation suffered incredibly event 73 million nonetheless explanation guilty priori that's context criminal trial that's presumption innocence kill child succeeded chance she's innocent isn't 73 million don't weighing strength evidence statistical evidence child died matter relative explanation they're implausible there's situation error statistic profound unfortunate consequence fact woman convicted basis evidence pediatrician subsequently released appeal case reviewed it's topical he's facing disrepute charge britain's general medical council conclude home message randomness uncertainty chance part everyday life it's true collective special way you're completely typical example gave it's documented people thing wrong make error logic reasoning uncertainty cope subtlety language brilliantly interesting evolutionary question good reasoning uncertainty that's issue everyday life you've heard talk statistic underpins enormous amount research science social science medicine lot industry quality control major impact industrial processing underpinned statistic it's we're bad recognize tend back legal context sally clark trial lawyer accepted expert pediatrician jury build bridge i've built road drive car home pediatrician don't build bridge that's engineer hand effectively implied reason uncertainty statistic that's fine he's expert understand competence isn't kind issue arose early day dna profiling scientist lawyer case judge routinely misrepresented evidence hope innocently misrepresented evidence forensic scientist chance guy's innocent million number 73 million that's meant celebrated appeal case britain finish context legal system it's let's present evidence case dna profiling expect jury ordinary people it's documented they're bad expect jury cope sort reasoning sphere life people argued possibly politics sphere life people argued illogically we'd that's good thing sort expect politician don't hope case uncertainty wrong time aware
