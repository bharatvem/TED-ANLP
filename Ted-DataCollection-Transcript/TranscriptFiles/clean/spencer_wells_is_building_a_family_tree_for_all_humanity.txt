jambo bonjour zdravstvujtye dayo language i've spoken bit week i've 17 country i'm crazy tour i've checking aspect project we're i'm bit visiting pretty incredible place place mongolia cambodia guinea south africa tanzania month ago opportunity make whirlwind tour world utterly amazing lot reason incredible stuff make spot comparison people globe thing kind surface thing we're i'm diversity globe 6 000 language spoken half billion people color shape size walk street big city travel amazed diversity human specie explain diversity that's i'm talk today we're tool genetics population genetics generated diversity long problem human diversity big scientific question explain broken question ferret question question origin share common origin fact that's assumption room make originate specie long divergent question related slightly spring common source occupy corner globe process generate diversity way life appearance language world question origin question biology answered darwin century ago descent man wrote great region world living mammal closely related extinct specie region it's probable africa inhabited extinct ape closely allied gorilla chimpanzee specie man's nearest ally it's probable early progenitor lived african continent we're home finished origin question darwin talking distant ancestry common ancestry ape clear ape originated african continent 23 million year ago fossil record africa disconnected landmass time due vagary plate tectonics floating indian ocean bumped eurasia 16 million year ago african exodus call ape left time ended southeast asia gibbon orangutan stayed africa evolved gorilla chimpanzee you're talking common ancestry ape it's clear fossil record started that's question i'm i'm human ancestry thing recognize sitting room peering shoulder wouldn't leap back human ancestry back share common ancestry living thing earth dna tie share ancestry barracuda bacteria mushroom back billion year we're human ancestry study historically studied science paleoanthropology digging thing ground largely basis morphology thing shaped skull shape bit ancestor i'm directly descended field paleoanthropology i'll argue lot fascinating possibility ancestry doesn't give probability scientist you're great extinct specie hominid potential human ancestor dug west olduvai gorge leakey family they're dating roughly time left we've homo erectus homo habilis australopithecus called paranthropus boisei robust australopithecine extinct specie place time mean direct ancestor guy related possibility ancestry probability we're approach morphology human data people hand recently largely skull shape person systematically linnaeus carl von linne swedish botanist eighteenth century categorize living organism planet you've tough job pretty good job categorized 12 000 specie systema naturae coined term homo sapiens mean wise man latin world diversity human discreet specie category talked african american asian european blatantly racist category termed monstrosus basically included people didn't including imaginary folk elf it's easy dismiss intentioned ultimately benighted musing eighteenth century scientist working pre darwinian era physical anthropology recently 20 30 year ago case learned basically classification humanity human race physical anthropologist 30 40 year ago carlton coon diverging post darwinian era million year time homo erectus based data morphology lot guesswork i'm talk today i'm talk approach problem guessing ancestry digging thing ground ancestor basis morphology don't completely understand don't genetic underlying morphological variation turn problem head we're genealogical problem genealogical question we're construct family tree alive today genealogist member family construct family tree trace back time start present relationship you're sibling parent common cousin share grandparent common gradually trace back past adding distant relationship eventually matter good digging church record stuff hit genealogist call brick wall point don't ancestor enter dark mysterious realm call history feel whispered guidance people written record written dna genetic code historical document take back time earliest day specie that's study quick primer dna suspect audience geneticist long linear molecule coded version make copy it's blueprint it's composed subunit g call it's sequence subunit defines blueprint long it's billion subunit length haploid genome copy chromosome haploid genome 3 2 billion nucleotide length thing add billion nucleotide long dna cell body stretch end end it's meter long dna cell body stretch end end reach moon back thousand time it's lot information you're copying dna molecule pas it's pretty tough job imagine longest book war peace multiply 100 imagine copying hand you're working late night you're careful you're drinking coffee you're paying attention occasionally you're copying hand you're make typo spelling mistake substitute e thing dna it's passed generation doesn't happen proofreading mechanism built happen transmitted generation marker descent share marker mean share ancestor point past person change dna it's pattern genetic variation pattern marker people world assessing relative age occurred history we've construct family tree alive today piece dna widely work mitochondrial dna tracing purely maternal line descent mtdna mother mother's mother back woman chromosome piece dna make men men trace purely paternal line descent room world fall lineage tree simplified version real tree they're kind complicated let's simplify turn side combine tree root bottom branch what's home message thing jump deepest lineage family tree found africa african mean african accumulating mutational diversity longer mean originated africa it's written dna piece dna greater diversity africa africa point past group african left african continent populate rest world recently share ancestry million year ago suspect incredible variation world dna tell story that's clear 200 000 year share ancestor single person mitochondrial eve heard africa african woman gave rise mitochondrial diversity world today what's amazing chromosome side male side story chromosome adam lived 60 000 year ago that's 2 000 human generation blink eye evolutionary sense tell living africa time african man gave rise chromosome diversity world it's 60 000 year started generate incredible diversity world amazing story we're effectively part extended african family recent didn't start leave earlier didn't homo erectus evolve separate specie specie human race world africa recently that's big question question genetics study history general big tough answer fails talk weather world's weather 60 000 year ago worst part ice age ice age started roughly 120 000 year ago started accelerate 70 000 year ago lot evidence sediment core pollen type oxygen isotope hit glacial maximum 16 000 year ago basically 70 000 year thing tough cold northern hemisphere massive growing ice sheet york city chicago seattle sheet ice britain scandinavia covered ice kilometer thick africa tropical continent planet 85 percent lie cancer capricorn aren't lot glacier high mountain east africa weren't covered ice africa africa drying time paleo climatological map africa looked 60 000 70 000 year ago reconstructed piece evidence mentioned reason ice suck moisture atmosphere antarctica it's technically desert precipitation world drying sea level dropping africa turning desert sahara bigger human habitat reduced small pocket compared today evidence genetic data human population time roughly 70 000 year ago crashed fewer 2 000 individual extinct hanging fingernail happened great illustration stone tool left africa million year ago made neanderthal distant cousin direct ancestor living europe date 50 000 60 000 year ago risk offending paleoanthropologists physical anthropologist audience basically there's lot change stone tool group left pretty similar period long cultural stasis million year ago 60 000 70 000 year ago tool style don't change evidence human life didn't change period 50 60 70 thousand year ago region hell break loose art make

complex idea i'm appeared time social social network expanded change behavior allowed survive worsening condition africa allowed start expand world we've talking conference african success story ultimate african success story mirror you're reason you're alive today brain place africa region we're sitting 60 70 thousand year ago allowing survive africa expand africa early coastal migration south coast asia leaving africa 60 000 year ago reaching australia rapidly 50 000 year ago slightly migration middle east savannah hunter post conference tour you'll real savannah it's basically meat
