today talk bionics popular term science replacing part living organism mechatronic device robot essentially stuff life meet machine specifically talk bionics evolving people arm amputation motivation arm amputation huge disability functional impairment clear hand amazing instrument lose lot harder thing physically huge emotional impact spend time clinic dealing emotional adjustment patient physical disability finally profound social impact talk hand greet hand interact physical world hand missing barrier arm amputation caused trauma thing industrial accident motor vehicle collision poignantly war child born arm called congenital limb deficiency great upper limb prosthetics general type called body powered prosthesis invented civil war refined world war world war ii patent arm 1912 lot patient work harnessing shoulder power squish shoulder pull bicycle cable bicycle cable open close hand hook bend elbow commonly robust simple device state art call myoelectric prosthesis motorized device controlled electrical signal muscle time contract muscle emits electricity record antenna electrode operate motorized prosthesis work pretty people lost hand hand muscle squeeze hand muscle contract open muscle contract intuitive work pretty higher level amputation lost arm elbow missing muscle hand elbow patient code system arm muscle operate robotic limb robotic limb market hand open close wrist rotator elbow function built arm rehab institute chicago added wrist flexion shoulder joint motor degree freedom opportunity work advanced arm funded u military prototype 10 degree freedom including movable hand end day robotic arm control neural interface connect nervous system thought process intuitive natural body work starting motor command brain spinal cord nerve periphery
