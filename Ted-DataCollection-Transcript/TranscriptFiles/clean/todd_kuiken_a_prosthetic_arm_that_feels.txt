today talk bionics popular term science replacing part living organism mechatronic device robot essentially stuff life meet machine specifically i'd talk bionics evolving people arm amputation motivation arm amputation huge disability functional impairment clear hand amazing instrument lose it's lot harder thing physically there's huge emotional impact spend time clinic dealing emotional adjustment patient physical disability finally there's profound social impact talk hand greet hand interact physical world hand they're missing it's barrier arm amputation caused trauma thing industrial accident motor vehicle collision poignantly war child born arm called congenital limb deficiency don't great upper limb prosthetics general type they're called body powered prosthesis invented civil war refined world war world war ii patent arm 1912 it's lot patient work harnessing shoulder power squish shoulder pull bicycle cable bicycle cable open close hand hook bend elbow commonly they're robust simple device state art call myoelectric prosthesis motorized device controlled electrical signal muscle time contract muscle emits electricity record antenna electrode operate motorized prosthesis work pretty people lost hand hand muscle squeeze hand muscle contract open muscle contract it's intuitive work pretty higher level amputation you've lost arm elbow you're missing muscle hand elbow patient code system arm muscle operate robotic limb robotic limb market hand open close wrist rotator elbow there's function built arm rehab institute chicago we've added wrist flexion shoulder joint motor degree freedom we've opportunity work advanced arm funded u military prototype 10 degree freedom including movable hand end day robotic arm control neural interface connect nervous system thought process it's intuitive it's natural body work starting motor command brain spinal cord nerve periphery sensation's exact opposite touch there's stimulus nerve back brain lose arm nervous system work nerve put command signal tap nerve ending world war ii vet he'll feel missing hand let's brain put brain record signal end peripheral nerve record exciting research area it's hard put hundred microscopic wire record tiny individual neuron ordinary fiber put tiny signal microvolt it's hard patient today developed approach we're biological amplifier amplify nerve signal muscle muscle amplify nerve signal thousand fold record top skin earlier approach call targeted reinnervation imagine who's lost arm major nerve arm nerve chest muscle nerve grow close hand section chest contract bend elbow section contract electrode antenna pick arm move that's idea man jesse sullivan he's saint man 54 year lineman touched wrong wire arm burnt badly amputated shoulder jesse ric fit state art device i'm technology bicycle cable side pick joint move chin switch left side he's modern motorized prosthesis joint operates pad shoulder touch make arm jesse's good crane operator standard required revision surgery chest gave opportunity targeted reinnervation colleague dr greg dumanian surgery cut nerve muscle arm nerve kind shift chest closed month nerve grew bit twitch month nerve grew strong contraction jesse think open close hand bend straighten elbow movement chest hash mark put antenna electrode challenge room make chest brain thinking arm learned chest learning process that's it's intuitive here's jesse test left hand side original prosthesis he's switch move block box he's arm 20 month he's pretty good side month fit targeted reinnervation prosthesis physical arm programmed he's faster smoother move block we're signal time surprise science we're motivated motor command drive robotic arm month touch jesse chest felt missing hand hand sensation grew chest lot fat skin muscle deinnervated skin touch jesse feel thumb touch feel pinky feel light touch gram force feel hot cold sharp dull missing hand hand chest attend exciting portal portal potentially give back sensation feel touch prosthetic hand imagine sensor hand coming pressing hand skin exciting we've initially primary population people elbow amputation deinnervate cut nerve segment muscle leave give signal give hand open close signal patient chris original device left month month he's time fast simple performance metric part job working great patient research collaborator we're fortunate today amanda kitts join amanda kitts amanda lost arm amanda kitts 2006 car accident driving home work truck coming opposite direction lane ran top car axle tore arm todd kuiken amputation healed you've conventional arm worked ak difficult work bicep tricep simple thing picking bend elbow cocontract change mode bicep hand close tricep open cocontract elbow work tk slow ak slow hard work concentrate lot tk month targeted reinnervation surgery month reinnervation fit prosthesis work ak work good elbow hand simultaneously work thought didn't cocontracting tk faster ak faster easy natural tk goal 20 year goal elbow hand intuitive time 50 patient world surgery including dozen wounded warrior u armed service success rate nerve transfer high it's 96 percent we're putting big fat nerve piece muscle intuitive control functional testing test show they're lot quicker lot easier important thing patient appreciated exciting there's lot information nerve signal wanted move finger move thumb wrist experiment saturated poor patient zillion electrode dozen task wiggling finger moving arm reaching recorded data algorithm lot speech recognition algorithm called pattern recognition jesse's chest thing pattern can't put electrode collaborated colleague university brunswick algorithm control amanda demonstrate ak elbow wrist rotation wrist flexion extension hand closed open tk amanda research arm it's made commercial component i've borrowed world it's pound arm weigh lost that's heavy amanda fact feel heavier it's glued she's carrying weight harness exciting part isn't mechatronics control we've developed small microcomputer blinking back operating train individual muscle signal amanda started arm long ak hour train hook computer couldn't train stopped working it's train piece back wear stop working reason retrain take minute tk we're excited we're clinically practical device that's goal clinically pragmatic wear we've amanda advanced arm showed earlier here's amanda arm made deka research corporation dean kamen presented ted year ago amanda good control it's pattern recognition hand grasp patient open hand grasp pattern mode hand grasp hand amanda deka arm ak key grip chuck grip power grasp fine pinch favorite hand open work kid time you're clapping singing good tk hand's good clapping ak can't clap tk that's exciting mechatronics make good put market field trial watch closely claudia oooooh tk that's claudia time feel sensation prosthetic sensor end prosthesis rubbed surface feel texture sandpaper grit ribbon cable pushed reinnervated hand skin ran table felt finger rocking that's exciting laboratory experiment give back potentially skin sensation here's video show challenge jesse he's squeezing foam toy harder squeeze black thing middle that's pushing skin proportional hard squeeze electrode i've real estate problem you're supposed put bunch thing motor's making kind noise electrode we're challenged we're future bright we're excited lot thing rid real estate problem signal develop tiny capsule size piece risotto put muscle telemeter emg signal it's worrying electrode contact real estate open sensation feedback build arm arm they're made 50th percentile male mean they're big eighth world super strong super fast arm we're making arm we're starting 25th percentile female hand wrap open degree freedom wrist elbow it'll smallest lightest smartest arm made small it's lot easier making bigger goal today i'd bit dark side yesterday's theme amanda jet lagged she's arm wrong computer spook broken wire converter sparked circuit hotel put fire alarm problem dealt bright research team thankfully dr annie simon worked hard yesterday fix that's science fortunately worked today
