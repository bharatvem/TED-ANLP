mathematical framework based generic universal principle answer question idea route recognizing extraordinary thing life scalable work extraordinary range tiny range it's mammal we're principle dynamic organization work including scale range 100 million size main reason life resilient robust scalability we're discus moment local level scale room scaled that's called growth here's grew rat that's rat we're pretty you're familiar grow quickly stop line prediction theory based principle describes forest growth rat point data point weight versus age stop growing good biology reason great resilience bad economy company city present paradigm economy thrusting illustrated left hand corner hockey stick bunch software company revenue versus age zooming making million billion dollar understand let's talk biology explicitly showing thing scale remarkable graph plotted metabolic rate energy day stay alive versus weight mass bunch organism it's plotted funny factor 10 couldn't graph plot slightly curious lie line fact complex diverse system universe there's extraordinary simplicity expressed it's astonishing organism subsystem cell type gene evolved unique environmental niche unique history darwinian evolution natural selection they've constrained lie line talk i've written bottom slope curve straight line it's quarter roughly call sublinear here's point linear steepest slope doubling size require double amount energy it's sublinear translates double size organism 75 percent energy wonderful thing biology express extraordinary economy scale bigger systematically

sigmoidal behavior grow fast stop part resilience bad economy city wonderful thing theory super linear scaling wealth creation innovation theory beautiful rising exponential curve lovely fact compare data fit development city economy terrible catch catch system destined collapse it's destined collapse reason kind malthusian reason run resource avoid we've grow approach collapse major innovation take place start start approach there's continuous cycle innovation order sustain growth avoid collapse catch innovate faster faster faster image we're treadmill that's faster change treadmill faster
