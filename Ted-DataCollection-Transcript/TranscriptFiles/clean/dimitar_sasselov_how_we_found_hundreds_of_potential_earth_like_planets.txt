i'm lucky talk essentially written historic event happened day month seemingly unrelated story today funeral precise reburial 22nd hero's reburial frombork poland 16th century astronomer changed world literally replacing earth sun center solar system simple act launched scientific technological revolution call copernican revolution ironically befittingly found grave custom time copernicus simply buried unmarked grave 14 cathedral dna analysis hallmark scientific revolution 400 year started found set bone belonged person read astronomical book filled leftover hair copernicus' hair people bothered read book match unambiguous dna matched nicolaus copernicus connection biology dna life tantalizing talk copernicus back follower quickly made logical step earth planet planet star idea plurality world life planet fact i'm borrowing popular book time time people answered question positively evidence begin 400 year frustration unfulfilled dream dream galileo giordano bruno led answer basic question humanity asked time life origin life happened 10 year end 20th century beautiful development due molecular biology understanding code life dna put closer answering basic question good news lot happened year let's start planet let's start copernican question earth star heard answer question it's telescope team befittingly named dreamer copernican time johannes kepler telescope's sole purpose find planet orbit star galaxy planet earth happen telescope built similarly hubble space telescope additional lens wide field lens call photographer couple month walk early evening straight place palm field sky telescope searching planet day night interruption year method call transit method it's mini eclipse occur planet pass front star planet fortuitously oriented million star you'll find planet animation kepler detect dimming light star image star planet star kepler point light learn lot planet learn size light dimmed depends big planet learn orbit period orbit learned walk understand news i'm today kepler discover lot candidate follow find planet confirm planet basically tell distribution planet size small planet bigger planet big planet count planet size solar system fact back ancient solar system sense diagram smaller planet big planet back time epicurus copernicus follower recently solar system earth planet small radius smaller time size earth mercury venus mar earth big giant planet copernican revolution brought telescope planet discovered total planet number solar system small planet dominated harmony copernicus happy note kepler big proponent pluto join number small planet literally 15 year ago knew planet that's frustration copernican dream unfulfilled finally 15 year ago technology point discover planet star pretty 15 year 500 planet discovered orbiting star method picture explanation big planet that's planet category jupiter haven't back copernicus didn't evidence planet earth care planet earth understood life chemical system smaller planet water rock lot complex chemistry originate emerge survive didn't evidence today i'm give glimpse telescope kepler week lo behold back harmony fulfilling dream copernicus small planet dominate picture planet marked earth planet time lot work candidate year confirm statistical result loud clear statistical result planet earth milky galaxy rich kind planet question study find call habitable meaning similar condition condition experience earth lot complex chemistry happen put number planet expect milky galaxy harbor number expect pretty staggering it's 100 million planet that's great news telescope year we'll identify 60 that's great study remotely technique tested past year find they're made atmosphere water carbon dioxide methane expect we'll that's great news that's i'm i'm step exciting part step enabling coming biology biology basic question stand unanswered essentially life planet expect life earth immediately life don't dolce vita good life human life life earth past present microbe human rich molecular diversity understand life earth set molecule chemical reaction call collectively biochemistry life chemical process chemical phenomenon question chemical phenomenon universal depends planet gravity universe kind biochemistry find that's basic question don't answer answer lab don't space answer question that's that's people lot good news part bridge

care sell half built bridge charming reason heard short talk today understanding chemistry daily life profound deeper deeper underlying point science process redefining life change worldview profound dissimilar 400 year ago copernicus' act changing view space time it's it's equally profound half time what's happened it's related kind sense insignificance humankind earth bigger space learn reinforced you've learned school small earth compared immense universe bigger telescope bigger universe image tiny blue dot pixel earth earth case orbit saturn it's tiny let's life entire planet sense
