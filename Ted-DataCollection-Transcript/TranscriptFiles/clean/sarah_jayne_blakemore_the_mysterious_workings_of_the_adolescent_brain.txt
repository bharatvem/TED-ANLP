fifteen year ago widely assumed vast majority brain development take place year life back 15 year ago ability inside living human brain track development lifespan past decade due advance brain imaging technology magnetic resonance imaging mri neuroscientist started inside living human brain age track brain structure brain function structural mri snapshot photograph high resolution inside living human brain question gray matter brain change age functional mri called fmri video movie brain activity participant taking part kind task thinking feeling perceiving lab world involved kind research rich detailed picture living human brain develops picture radically changed human brain development revealing early childhood brain continues develop adolescence 20 30 adolescence defined period life

portraying adolescent similar light light portray today today understand behavior term underlying brain risk taking adolescent tendency risk risk child adult prone taking risk friend important drive independent parent impress friend adolescence understand term development part brain called limbic system show limbic system red slide brain limbic system deep inside brain involved thing emotion processing reward processing rewarding feeling fun thing including taking risk kick taking risk region region limbic system found hypersensitive rewarding feeling risk taking adolescent compared adult time prefrontal cortex blue slide stop taking excessive risk development adolescent brain research shown adolescent brain undergoes profound development implication education rehabilitation intervention environment including teaching shape developing adolescent brain recently routinely educating teenager west grandparent left school early adolescence choice case teenager world today forty percent teenager access secondary school education period life brain adaptable malleable fantastic opportunity learning creativity problem adolescent heightened risk taking poor impulse control consciousness stigmatized reflects brain provide excellent opportunity education social development
