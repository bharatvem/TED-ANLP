fifteen year ago widely assumed vast majority brain development take place year life back 15 year ago didn't ability inside living human brain track development lifespan past decade due advance brain imaging technology magnetic resonance imaging mri neuroscientist started inside living human brain age track brain structure brain function structural mri you'd snapshot photograph high resolution inside living human brain question gray matter brain change age functional mri called fmri video movie brain activity participant taking part kind task thinking feeling perceiving lab world involved kind research rich detailed picture living human brain develops picture radically changed human brain development revealing it's early childhood brain continues develop adolescence '20s '30s adolescence defined period life start biological hormonal physical puberty end age individual attains stable independent role society long time brain region dramatically adolescence called prefrontal cortex model human brain prefrontal cortex front prefrontal cortex interesting brain area it's proportionally bigger human specie it's involved range high level cognitive function thing decision making planning planning you're tomorrow week year inhibiting inappropriate behavior stopping rude stupid it's involved social interaction understanding people awareness mri study development region shown undergoes dramatic development period adolescence gray matter volume gray matter volume age age 22 year increase childhood graph peak early adolescence arrow peak gray matter volume prefrontal cortex peak couple year boy relative girl that's boy puberty couple year girl average adolescence there's significant decline gray matter volume prefrontal cortex sound bad important developmental process gray matter cell body connection cell synapsis decline gray matter volume prefrontal cortex thought correspond synaptic pruning elimination unwanted synapsis important process it's partly dependent environment animal human synapsis strengthened synapsis aren't environment pruned bit pruning rosebush prune weaker branch remaining important branch grow stronger process effectively fine tune brain tissue specie specific environment happening prefrontal cortex brain region period human adolescence line inquiry track adolescent brain functional mri brain activity age i'll give lab lab we're interested social brain network brain region understand people interact people show photograph soccer game illustrate aspect social brain work soccer game michael owen missed goal he's lying ground aspect social brain picture nicely illustrates automatic instinctive social emotional response split michael owen missing goal thing arm thing face michael owen slide grass thing arm similar facial expression people don't guy yellow back they're wrong end stadium they're social emotional response instantly recognize that's aspect social brain picture nicely illustrates good reading people's behavior action gesture facial expression term underlying emotion mental state don't guy pretty good idea they're feeling thinking precise moment time that's we're interested lab lab bring adolescent adult lab brain scan give kind task involves thinking people mind mental state emotion finding we've found time lab world part prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex shown blue slide it's middle prefrontal cortex midline head region active adolescent make social decision people adult meta analysis study area lab world show thing activity medial prefrontal cortex area decrease period adolescence adolescent adult mental approach cognitive strategy make social decision behavioral study bring people lab give kind behavioral task i'll give kind task lab imagine you're participant experiment lab computerized task task set shelf object shelf you'll notice there's guy standing set shelf object can't they're occluded point view kind gray piece wood set shelf point view notice object object task move object director standing set shelf direct move object remember he's move object can't introduces interesting condition there's kind conflict perspective director's perspective imagine tell move top truck left truck you're instinctively white truck that's top truck perspective remember can't truck move blue truck top truck perspective normal healthy intelligent adult make error 50 percent time kind trial move white truck blue truck give kind task adolescent adult control condition there's director give people rule we're thing time there's director you've ignore object dark gray background you'll condition director condition remember apply arbitrary rule director condition remember account director's perspective order guide ongoing behavior show percentage error large developmental study study ranging age adulthood you're percentage error adult group condition gray director condition intelligent adult making error 50 percent time make fewer error there's director present remember rule ignoring gray background developmentally condition develop late childhood mid adolescence there's improvement word reduction error trial condition it's compare group mid adolescent group adult group thing interesting continued improvement director condition word order remember rule apply fully developed mid adolescence contrast gray bar there's significant improvement director condition mid adolescence adulthood mean ability account else's perspective order guide ongoing behavior everyday life time developing mid late adolescence teenage son daughter problem taking people's perspective you're laugh teenager they're parodied demonized medium kind typical teenage behavior risk they're moody they're conscious nice anecdote friend mine thing noticed teenage daughter puberty level embarrassment front puberty daughter messing shop i'd 'hey stop messing i'll sing favorite song ' instantly they'd stop messing he'd sing favorite song puberty threat notion dad singing public make behave people adolescence kind recent phenomenon we've invented recently west answer lot description adolescence history sound similar description today there's famous quote shakespeare winter's tale describes adolescence age ten twenty youth sleep rest wench child wronging ancientry stealing fighting boiled brain nineteen twenty hunt weather 400 year ago shakespeare portraying adolescent similar light light portray today today understand behavior term underlying brain risk taking adolescent tendency risk risk child adult prone taking risk they're friend there's important drive independent one's parent impress one's friend adolescence understand term development part brain called limbic system i'm show limbic system red slide brain limbic system deep inside brain it's involved thing emotion processing reward processing rewarding feeling fun thing including taking risk kick taking risk region region limbic system found hypersensitive rewarding feeling risk taking adolescent compared adult time prefrontal cortex blue slide stop taking excessive risk development adolescent brain research shown adolescent brain undergoes profound development implication education rehabilitation intervention environment including teaching shape developing adolescent brain it's recently routinely educating teenager west grandparent left school early adolescence choice that's case teenager world today forty percent teenager don't access secondary school education period life brain adaptable malleable it's fantastic opportunity learning creativity what's problem adolescent heightened risk taking poor impulse control consciousness shouldn't stigmatized reflects brain provide excellent opportunity education social development
