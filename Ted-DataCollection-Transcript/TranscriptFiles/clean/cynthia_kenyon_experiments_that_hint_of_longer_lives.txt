increase health longevity people exciting foxo protein found round worm affect lifespan affect lifespan people we've lab develop drug activate foxo cell human cell order drug delay aging age related disease i'm optimistic work lot protein affect aging drug there's called tor nutrient sensor insulin pathway mutation damage tor gene daf 2 mutation extend lifespan worm fly mouse case there's drug called rapamycin bind tor protein inhibits activity rapamycin give mouse it's pretty age 60 human mouse give mouse rapamycin live longer don't taking rapamycin drug people reason suppresses immune system people prevent organ transplant rejected perfect drug staying young longer year 2011 there's drug give mouse pretty age extend lifespan science that's animal i'm optimistic won't long hope age dream begin true matt ridley cynthia straight you're drug solve aging men pretty lab allowed ethically start human life scratch altered gene make live lot longer ck ah kind drug talking change gene bind protein change activity stop taking drug protein back normal change gene principle isn't technology don't that's good idea reason hormone insulin igf hormone tor pathway they're essential knock completely you're sick fine tune carefully benefit problem that's kind control drug way activating foxo don't involve insulin igf 1 safer mr wasn't suggesting there's phenomenon written spoken
