18 minute absolutely brutal time limit i'm dive straight point thing work i'm talk thing i'm talk defeating aging desirable i'm talk shit talk bit i'm talk feasibility i'm talk fatalistic aging i'm spend half talk talking prove fatalism wrong i'm step i'm talk modest amount life extension i'm define 30 year applied people middle age start point genuinely called defeating aging essentially elimination relationship die year sick place thing i'm talk reach intermediate step point 30 year life extension i'm start question hand audience favor malaria easy hand audience who's malaria good thing bad thing malaria bad thing that's good news thought answer thing put main reason malaria bad thing characteristic malaria share aging characteristic real difference aging kill considerably people malaria audience britain talk comparison foxhunting banned long struggle government month ago i'm sympathetic audience lot people persuaded logic good comparison lot people city boy business telling rural type time it's traditional part life allowed carry it's ecologically sound stop population explosion fox ultimately government prevailed end majority british public majority member parliament conclusion tolerated civilized society human aging share characteristic spade part people understand it's life it's healthy life frail miserable dependent fun dying fun describe it's global trance sort unbelievable excuse people give aging i'm excuse completely valueless good point made thing thinking forward planning minimize turbulence figure fix aging completely crazy remember sense proportion argument thing legitimate concerned question dangerous risk aging outweigh downside opposite leaving aging bad outweigh condemning 100 000 people day unnecessarily early death haven't argument that's strong don't waste time argument people strong people worry overpopulation fix aging one's die speak death toll lower crossing st giles carelessly we're kid kid important people that's true lot people fudge question give answer don't agree answer basically don't work it's true face dilemma respect decide low birth rate high death rate high death rate arise simply rejecting therapy favor carrying lot kid that's fine future humanity entitled make choice what's fine make choice behalf future vacillate hesitate develop therapy condemning cohort people young healthy benefit therapy haven't developed quickly we'll denying people indefinite life span immoral that's answer overpopulation question thing bit active fundamental answer pro aging trance dumb it's coping inevitability aging aging ghastly it's inevitable we've find put mind it's rational making ridiculous reason aging good thing work component inevitability bit bit unclear range aging part problem pro aging trance stop agitating thing that's talk lot evangelize lot order people's attention make people realize trance regard that's i'm i'm talk feasibility fundamental reason feel aging inevitable summed definition aging i'm giving simple definition aging side effect alive place metabolism completely tautological statement it's reasonable statement aging basically process inanimate object car fact lot clever repair mechanism repair mechanism perfect basically metabolism defined basically alive day side effect side effect accumulate eventually pathology that's fine definition put chain event game town people regard postponing aging they're i'm calling gerontology approach geriatrics approach geriatrician intervene late day pathology evident geriatrician hold back sand time stop accumulation side effect causing pathology it's short term ist strategy it's losing battle thing causing pathology abundant time gerontology approach promising surface prevention cure thing don't understand metabolism fact pitifully poor understanding organism work cell we're good we've discovered thing rna interference year ago fundamental component cell work basically gerontology fine approach end approach time we're talking intervention that's fine logic sound pretty convincing pretty ironclad doesn't isn't isn't i'm bit i'm calling step suppose acquire let's today sake argument ability confer 30 extra year healthy life people middle age let's 55 i'm call robust human rejuvenation long people age today equivalently age time therapy arrive live order answer question it's simple it's simple can't they're young benefit therapy they'll live 30 year longer that's wrong answer reason it's wrong answer progress sort technological progress purpose fundamental major breakthrough incremental refinement breakthrough differ great deal term predictability time frame fundamental breakthrough hard predict long it's make fundamental breakthrough long time ago decided flying fun 1903 work thing pretty steady pretty uniform reasonable sequence event happened progression technology powered flight sort imagination inventor previous incremental advance added incremental anymore sort thing fundamental breakthrough sort technology computer parallel time line happening bit medical care hygiene vaccine antibiotic sort time frame step called step moment ago isn't step fact people young benefit therapy give moderate amount life extension people middle aged therapy arrive sort cusp survive long receive improved treatment give 30 50 year word staying ahead game therapy improving faster remaining imperfection therapy catching important point people hear predict lot people alive today live 1 000 i'm we're invent therapy decade eliminating aging therapy live 1 000 i'm i'm rate improvement therapy they'll perfect we'll fix thing 200 year old die 200 year old 300 400 decided give longevity escape velocity point trajectory basically expect people live term remaining life expectancy measured health age time therapy arrive you're 100 you're 80 average 80 year can't lot therapy you're close death's door initial experimental therapy good won't withstand you're 50 there's chance pull dive eventually start biologically younger meaningful sense term youthfulness physical mental term risk death age related you're bit younger you're fragile die age related genuine conclusion 150 year don't person today don't long it's generation therapy irrespective age i'm claiming person live 1 000 subject global catastrophe 10 year younger 150 year that's thought alright finally i'm spend rest talk half minute step moderate amount life extension escape velocity order talk mouse bit milestone robust human rejuvenation i'm calling robust mouse rejuvenation imaginatively we're long lived strain mouse basically mean mouse live year average they're year bunch stuff therapy live average birthday word add year treble remaining lifespan starting point started therapy question time frame milestone talked earlier human i've explained equivalently call robust human rejuvenation longevity escape velocity public's perception long it's thing starting time mouse thirdly question people question biology question it's extremely hard answer speculative colleague speculation simply counsel that's nonsense absolutely irresponsible stay silent give guess time frame order give people sense proportion ass priority 50 50 chance reaching rhr milestone robust human rejuvenation 15 year point robust mouse rejuvenation 15 year robust mouse public's perception public underestimate difficult scientific thing they'll it's year they'll wrong won't matter finally it's fair large part reason public ambivalent aging global trance spoke earlier coping strategy history point longer aging inevitable human it's postponed effectively mouse we're end strong change people's attitude enormous implication order we're mouse i'm add bit description aging i'm word damage denote intermediate thing caused metabolism eventually pathology critical thing damage eventually pathology damage caused ongoing ly life starting we're born part metabolism turn draw original diagram fundamentally difference gerontology geriatrics gerontology inhibit rate metabolism lay damage i'm explain damage concrete biological term moment geriatrician hold back sand time stopping damage converting pathology reason it's losing battle damage continuing accumulate there's approach call engineering approach claim engineering approach range engineering approach intervene process intervene

we're made cell stuff cell damage accumulate answer long lived molecule short lived molecule undergoes damage molecule destroyed protein destroyed proteolysis damage it's long lived molecule thing discussion gerontology long time ago pretty good news mean we've long biology 20 year fact haven't extended list pretty good indication there's extension it's fix mouse principle principle implement fix decade partially implemented top haven't time conclusion suitable funding develop robust mouse rejuvenation 10 year start biologist audience give answer question dissatisfied talk fundamentally read stuff i've published great deal cite experimental work optimism based there's lot detail detail make confident aggressive time frame i'm predicting i'm wrong you'd damn find i'm wrong main thing shouldn't trust people call gerontologist radical departure previous thinking field expect people mainstream bit resistant you've homework order understand true we'll end thing thing you'll hearing guy session time ago sequence human genome half time it's impossible happened happen strategy there's methuselah mouse prize basically incentive innovate work money win there's proposal put institute what's bit money long spend war iraq long it's philanthropic profit distract biotech it's basically 90 percent chance succeeding i'll stop chris anderson don't there's question thought give people
