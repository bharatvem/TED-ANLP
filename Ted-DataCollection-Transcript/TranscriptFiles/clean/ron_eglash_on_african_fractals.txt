start story germany 1877 mathematician named georg cantor cantor decided line erase middle line resulting line bring back process recursive process start line 16 infinite number time mathematics end infinite number line infinite number point realized set number element larger infinity blew mind literally checked sanitarium sanitarium convinced put earth found transfinite set theory largest set infinity god religious man mathematician mission mathematician sort thing swedish mathematician von koch decided subtracting line add beautiful curve there's reason start seed shape seed shape i'll rearrange i'll stick iteration seed shape sort unfolds structure property similarity part it's pattern scale mathematician thought strange shrink ruler measure longer longer length iteration infinite number time ruler shrink infinity length infinity made sense consigned curve back math book pathological curve don't discus worked hundred year 1977 benoit mandelbrot french mathematician realized computer graphic shape called fractal shape nature human lung acacia tree fern beautiful natural form thumb index finger meet ahead relax hand you'll crinkle wrinkle crinkle crinkle wrinkle body covered fractal mathematician pathologically useless shape breathing word fractal lung it's ironic i'll show natural recursion line recursively replace shape here's iteration fourth nature similar structure nature organizing system 1980s happened notice aerial photograph african village fractal thought fabulous africa folk fulbright scholarship travel africa year people building fractal great job finally city i'd fractal model city sort unfold palace chief french good mathematician stand roof cool talked fractal yeah yeah knew rectangle rectangle turn royal insignia rectangle rectangle rectangle path palace spiral path polite they're mapping social scaling geometric scaling it's conscious pattern unconscious termite mound fractal village southern zambia ba ila built village 400 meter diameter huge ring ring represent family enclosure larger larger back chief's ring back chief's family ring here's fractal model here's house sacred altar here's house house family enclosure human sacred altar here's village ring ring ring chief's extended family chief's family there's tiny village big people fit tiny village big that's they're spirit people it's ancestor spirit people miniature village village it's georg cantor recursion continues forever mandara mountain nigerian border cameroon mokoulek diagram drawn french architect thought wow beautiful fractal seed shape iteration unfold thing structure let's iteration fourth simulation realized village kind spiral here's replicating line replicating line unfolds fractal noticed line square building village village square building something's can't inside that's sacred altar sacrifice year annual cycle fertility field started realize cycle fertility recursive cycle geometric algorithm build recursion village continues tiny scale here's nankani village mali inside family enclosure inside here's pot fireplace stacked recursively here's calabash issa showing they're stacked recursively tiniest calabash woman's soul dy ceremony break stack called zalanga soul eternity infinity important question point aren't scaling pattern universal indigenous architecture original hypothesis african fractal thought wow indigenous group doesn't state society sort hierarchy kind bottom architecture turn true started collecting aerial photograph native american south pacific architecture african fractal society geometric design theme native american combination circular symmetry fourfold symmetry pottery basket here's aerial photograph anasazi ruin it's circular largest scale it's rectangular smaller scale pattern scale dr eglash aren't ignoring diversity african culture time answer agree mudimbe's wonderful book invention africa africa artificial invention colonialism oppositional movement widely shared design practice doesn't necessarily give unity culture dna finally fractal similarity they're similar they're necessarily similar fractal it's shared technology africa finally isn't intuition it's mathematical knowledge african can't possibly fractal geometry wasn't invented 1970s it's true african fractal i'm concerned pure intuition thing i'd wander street dakar people what's algorithm what's rule making they'd make pretty stupid that's case case algorithm sophisticated algorithm manghetu sculpture you'd recursive geometry ethiopian cross wonderful unfolding shape angola chokwe people draw line sand it's german mathematician euler called graph call eulerian path lift stylus surface line recursively age grade system kid learn older kid learn age grade initiation learn iteration algorithm learn iteration myth learn level knowledge finally africa board game it's called owari ghana studied it's called mancala east coast bao kenya sogo organizing pattern spontaneously occur board game folk ghana knew organizing pattern strategically conscious knowledge here's wonderful fractal sahel you'll windscreen fence world cartesian strictly linear africa you've nonlinear scaling fence tracked folk make thing guy mali bamako asked you're making fractal fence answer interesting lived jungle long row straw they're quick they're cheap doesn't time doesn't straw wind dust pretty easily tight row top hold wind dust take lot time take lot straw they're tight experience farther ground stronger wind blow it's cost benefit analysis measured length straw put log log plot scaling exponent match scaling exponent relationship wind speed height wind engineering handbook guy target practical scaling technology complex algorithmic approach fractal found geometry symbolic code bamana sand divination divination system found africa find east coast west coast symbol preserved symbol bit it's bit binary word draw line sand randomly count it's odd number put stroke it's

georg cantor 1877 started explaining africa excited cantor set initiation ritual bamana priest interested math time shaking head didn't learn sleep kola nut bed buried sand give coin leper finally revealed truth matter turn it's pseudo random number generator deterministic chaos bit symbol put sideways odd odd odd odd odd odd it's addition modulo 2 parity bit check computer symbol put back it's
