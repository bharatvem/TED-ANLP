hundred year ago month 36 year albert einstein stood front prussian academy science berlin present radical theory space time gravity general theory relativity general relativity unquestionably einstein's masterpiece theory reveals working universe grandest scale capturing beautiful line algebra apple fall tree beginning time space 1915 exciting year physicist idea turning subject head einstein's theory relativity arguably revolutionary quantum mechanic mind meltingly strange stunningly successful understanding microworld world atom particle century idea utterly transformed understanding universe it's relativity quantum mechanic we've learned universe made began continues evolve hundred year find turning point physic what's stake year we'll continue increase understanding nature time history science facing question answer don't brain technology law physic forbid essential problem universe interesting relativity quantum mechanic suggest universe boring

fine tuning dangerous number time end scale studying universe vast distance important consequence einstein's general theory relativity discovery universe began rapid expansion space time 13 8 billion year ago big bang early version big bang theory universe expanding gravity gradually putting brake expansion 1998 astronomer made stunning discovery expansion universe speeding universe bigger bigger faster faster driven mysterious repulsive force called dark energy hear word dark physic suspicious mean don't we're talking don't dark energy idea it's energy empty space energy vacuum good quantum mechanic work strong dark energy absolutely astonishing result find dark energy 10 power 120 time stronger observe astronomy that's 120 zero number mind bogglingly huge it's impossible head word astronomical we're talking big number won't number bigger number astronomy it's thousand trillion trillion trillion time bigger number atom entire universe that's pretty bad prediction fact it's called worst prediction physic theoretical curiosity dark energy strong universe torn star galaxy form dangerous number strength dark energy explaining requires fantastic level fine tuning higgs field unlike higgs field number explanation hope complete combination einstein's general theory relativity theory universe grand scale quantum mechanic theory universe small scale provide solution einstein spent year futile search unified theory physic physicist promising candidate unified theory string theory essential idea zoom fundamental particle make world you'd they're particle tiny vibrating string energy frequency vibration particle bit musical note guitar string it's elegant poetic world catastrophic problem turn string theory isn't theory collection theory it's estimated fact 10 500
