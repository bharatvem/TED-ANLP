i'm pleased today talk repair damaged brain i'm excited field neurologist offer great way offer hope patient today live devastating untreatable disease brain here's problem picture somebody's brain alzheimer's disease healthy brain what's obvious alzheimer's brain ringed red there's obvious damage atrophy scarring show equivalent picture disease multiple sclerosis motor neuron disease parkinson's disease huntington's disease similar story collectively brain disorder represent major public health threat time number staggering time 35 million people today living brain disease annual cost globally 700 billion dollar that's greater percent global gdp worse number rising large age related disease we're living longer question devastating impact disease individual mind scale societal problem effective treatment order give crash brain work word learned medical school isn't long brain terribly simple it's made cell shown there's nerve cell there's myelinating cell insulating cell it's called oligodendrocyte cell work health harmony create extraordinary symphony electrical activity electrical activity underpins ability emote remember learn move feel equally individual cell rogue die damage damaged wiring disrupted connection that's evident slower conduction ultimately damage manifest disease starting dying nerve cell motor nerve you'll motor neuron disease i'd give real life illustration motor neuron disease patient mine called john john week clinic i've asked john problem led initial diagnosis motor neuron disease john diagnosed october 2011 main problem breathing problem difficulty breathing siddharthan chandran don't caught john telling difficulty breathing led eventually diagnosis motor neuron disease john's 18 month journey i've asked current predicament john i've breathing's worse i've weakness hand arm leg basically i'm wheelchair time sc john's told he's wheelchair time clip show devastating consequence disease shocking pace disease 18 month fit adult man rendered wheelchair respirator dependent let's face john anybody's father brother friend that's motor nerve dy myelin cell dy multiple sclerosis scan left illustration brain it's map connection brain superimposed area damage call lesion demyelination they're damage they're white you're thinking you're thinking god bloke he's talk hope he's give bleak depressing tale i've told disease terrible they're devastating number rising cost ridiculous worst treatment where's hope hope there's hope section brain section illustrates amazingly brain repair doesn't thing show damage patient it's white mass crucially area that's ringed red highlight area pale blue area pale blue white damaged it's repaired clear it's doctor it's spite doctor doctor spontaneous repair it's amazing it's occurred stem cell brain enable myelin insulation laid damaged nerve observation important reason challenge orthodoxy learnt medical school admittedly century brain doesn't repair unlike bone liver doesn't thing clear direction travel therapy don't rocket scientist simply find way promoting endogenous spontaneous repair occurs question we've time treatment part reflects complexity drug development drug development expensive risky bet odds bet roughly they're 10 000 screen 10 000 compound find potential winner spend 15 year spend billion dollar winner question change rule game shorten odds order bottleneck drug discovery bottleneck early drug discovery screening occurs animal model proper study mankind man borrow alexander pope question study disease human material absolutely stem cell specifically human stem cell human stem cell extraordinary simple cell thing renew make specialized make bone liver crucially nerve cell motor nerve cell myelin cell challenge long harness power undoubted power stem cell order realize promise regenerative neurology reason major discovery 10 20 year edinburgh celebrity sheep dolly dolly made edinburgh dolly cloning mammal adult cell significant breakthrough purpose discussion today made 2006 japanese scientist called yamanaka yamaka fantastic form scientific cookery showed ingredient ingredient effectively convert cell adult cell master stem cell significance difficult exaggerate mean room patient generate bespoke personalized tissue repair kit skin cell make master pluripotent cell make cell relevant disease study potentially treat idea medical school recurring theme isn't medical school ridiculous it's absolute reality today cornerstone regeneration repair hope whilst we're theme hope failed school there's hope school report john gerdon idea scientist present showing ridiculous didn't nobel prize medicine month ago return original problem opportunity stem cell disruptive technology repairing damaged brain call regenerative neurology way fantastic 21st century drug discovery tool form therapy bit moment drug discovery dish people talk it's simple patient disease let's motor neuron disease skin sample pluripotent reprogramming i've told generate live motor nerve cell that's straightforward that's pluripotent cell crucially compare behavior equivalent healthy counterpart ideally unaffected relative you're matching genetic variation that's collaboration colleague london chris shaw u steve finkbeiner tom maniatis you're amazing living growing motor nerve cell patient motor neuron disease inherited form imagine unimaginable 10 year ago grow put process engineer fluoresce crucially track individual health compare diseased motor nerve cell healthy put realize diseased represented red line half time die healthy counterpart crucial point fantastic assay discover drug drug high throughput automated screening system you'd drug give thing find drug bring red line closer blue line drug high candidate direct human trial bypass bottleneck i've told drug discovery animal model make sense it's fantastic back stem cell directly repair damage way they're mutually exclusive long run give biggest dividend it's thought stem cell brain i've told stem cell brain diseased brain surely smart forward find way promote activate stem cell brain react respond appropriately damage repair future drug effectively parachute cell transplant replace dying lost cell brain experiment it's clinical trial recently completed colleague ucl david miller study simple patient multiple sclerosis asked simple question stem cell bone marrow protective nerve bone marrow grew stem cell lab injected back vein i'm making sound simple year lot people put gray hair caused kind issue conceptually it's essentially simple we've vein order measure successful measured optic nerve outcome measure that's good thing measure patient sadly suffer problem vision loss vision unclear vision measured size optic nerve scan david miller time 12 month month infusion gently declining red line that's telling optic nerve shrinking make sense nerve dying gave stem cell infusion repeated measurement month month surprise line's suggests intervention protective don't what's happened stem cell made myelin nerve they've they've promoted endogenous stem cell precursor cell job wake lay myelin proof concept i'm excited end theme began regeneration hope i've asked john hope future john hope future research people cure people lead normal life sc speaks volume i'd close thanking john thanking john allowing share insight clip i'd add john view i'm hopeful future disruptive technology stem cell i've explain offer real hope day repair damaged brain sooner
