salt people that's true area salt completely price low death continue abated there's biological answer death simple rehydration doesn't solve that's true death completely preventable disconcerting thing call mile problem spent lot energy domain technological scientific hard work creativity human ingenuity crack important social problem technology solution that's discovery 2 000 year that's mankind moving forward case cracked big part problem remains hundred ninety mile mile's proving incredibly stubborn that's oral rehydration therapy unique diarrhea turn thing disconcerting it's unique diarrhea it's unique poor people india here's variety context i've put bunch example i'll start insulin diabetes medication u american population medicaid you're fairly poor medicaid health insurance insulin pretty straightforward pill form injection day maintain blood sugar level massive technological advance incredibly deadly disease made solvable adherence rate people taking insulin day average typical person taking 75 percent time result 25 000 people year blind hundred thousand lose limb year that's solvable bunch example suffer mile problem it's medicine here's technology agriculture there's food problem create seed there's income problem create way farming increase income way way we'd cracked intercropping intercropping increase income rice found incredible increase yield mix variety rice side side people what's mile mile problematic alright what's problem problem pound machine that's eye ear machine strange consequence people weird lot inconsistent thing lot inconsistent

struggling back diarrhea here's question asked national sample survey survey asked indian woman child diarrhea increase maintain decrease number fluid don't embarrass i'll give answer it's increase diarrhea's interesting it's thousand year humankind lived side side polluted water roman strategy interesting gave comparative advantage made soldier didn't drink remotely muddied water troop diarrhea they're effective battlefield roman comparative advantage part breast shield breastplate part drinking water woman they've parent struggled diarrhea they've struggled diarrhea they've lot death answer question india 35 50 percent reduce mean thirty 50 percent woman forget oral rehydration therapy increasing making child die action possibility that's people respond that's stupid don't that's stupid
