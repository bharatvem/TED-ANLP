i'm garbage man find interesting garbage man absolutely hate waste hope 10 minute change lot stuff life i'd start beginning back kid stuff life toddler rule it's stuff entire pile stuff i'm building stuff that's mine it's stuff it's broken spending 20 year recycling industry it's pretty clear don't necessarily leave toddler rule develop adult perspective day recycling plant world handle million pound people's discarded stuff million pound day sound lot stuff it's tiny drop durable good disposed year world percent fact united nation estimate there's 85 billion pound year electronics waste discarded world year that's rapidly growing part waste stream throw durable good automobile number double developed country bigger mountain mountain people garbage ground mine reason mine there's lot valuable raw material making stuff place it's increasingly important figure extract raw material extremely complicated waste stream we've heard week ted world's smaller place people stuff toy tool granted making toy tool single day it's type plastic type metal metal typically ore mine widening mine deepening mine world plastic oil remote location drill deeper well extract practice significant economic environmental implication we're starting today good news starting recover material end life stuff starting recycle end life stuff region world europe recycling policy place require stuff recycled responsible manner what's extracted end life stuff make recycler metal put perspective i'm steel proxy metal it's common metal stuff make recycler 90 percent metal recovered reused purpose plastic story 10 percent recovered fact it's percent it's incinerated landfilled people that's plastic throw material plastic time valuable steel there's plastic produced consumed world volume basis year steel plentiful valuable material recovered rate valuable material it's predominantly metal easy recycle material density electrical magnetic property color it's easy human machine separate metal material plastic overlapping density narrow range identical similar electrical magnetic property plastic color traditional way separating material simply don't work plastic consequence metal easy recycle human lot stuff developed world sadly united state don't recycling policy place europe find developing country low cost recycling people dollar day pick stuff extract metal circuit board leave can't recover plastic burn plastic metal burn house extract metal hand low economic cost solution low environmental human health safety solution call environmental arbitrage it's fair it's safe it's sustainable plastic plentiful method don't lead recovery plastic people recover plastic photo standing rooftop largest slum world mumbai india store plastic roof bring roof small workshop people hard separate plastic color shape feel technique they'll resort what's burn sniff technique they'll burn plastic smell fume determine type plastic technique result amount recycling significant don't technique home space age material call space aged material plastic it's valuable abundant putting back ground send smoke 20 year ago literally started garage tinkering figure separate similar material eventually enlisted lot friend mining world plastic world started mining laboratory world we're ground mining eventually broke code frontier recycling it's major material recovered significant amount earth finally figured process started recreating plastic industry make plastic traditional make plastic oil petrochemical breakdown molecule recombine specific way make wonderful plastic enjoy day there's sustainable make plastic sustainable environmental standpoint sustainable economic standpoint good place start waste doesn't cost oil it's plentiful hope you've photograph we're breaking plastic molecule recombining we're mining approach extract material significantly lower capital cost plant equipment enormous energy saving don't project planet save 80 90 percent energy compared making traditional plopping hundred million dollar build chemical plant make type plastic entire life plant make type plastic feed make drop replacement plastic that's made petrochemical customer enjoy huge co2 saving close loop product make sustainable product short time period show bit sense start metal recyclers shred stuff small bit recover metal leave what's called shredder residue it's waste complex mixture material predominantly plastic thing aren't plastic metal missed carpeting foam rubber wood glass paper occasional dead animal part process traditional recycling we're sieving material we're magnet we're air classification willy wonka factory point end process mixed plastic composite type plastic grade plastic sophisticated part process hard work multi step separation process begin grind plastic size small fingernail highly automated process sort plastic type grade end part process flake plastic type grade optical sorting color sort material blend 50 000 lb blending silo push material extruders melt push small die hole make spaghetti plastic strand chop strand called pellet currency plastic industry material oil today we're producing stuff it's back stuff stuff ending hillside developing country literally smoke find stuff back top desk product office back work home example company buying plastic replacing virgin plastic make product hope i've changed stuff life clue mother nature mother nature waste reuses practically hope stop consumer that's label i've hated entire life resource form transformed form time finally hope agree change toddler rule bit it's broken it's stuff time
