difficult task i'm spectroscopist talk astronomy showing single image nebula galaxy job spectroscopy deal image i'll convince spectroscopy change world spectroscopy answer question seti it's fun spectroscopy colleague bulgaria nevena markova spent 20 year studying profile published 42 article dedicated subject imagine day night thinking observing star 20 year incredible crazy thing i'm spent month working profile i've noticed small symmetry profile planet host star thought lithium 6 star indication star swallowed planet apparently can't fragile isotope lithium 6 atmosphere sun star planet asteroid engulf planet large number asteroid lithium 6 isotope spectrum star invested month studying profile star it's amazing phone call reporter planet star thought telescope astronomer telescope planet star excuse it's incredible understood bet people understood i'm talking indication planet star it's amazing power spectroscopy realized pink floyd 1973 color spectrum time money make spectrograph number high resolution precise spectrograph planet called harp detect extrasolar planet sound wave atmosphere star spectrum i'm school physic it's basically splitting white light color liquid hot mass produce call continuous spectrum hot gas producing emission line continuum place cool gas front hot source pattern call absorption line identify chemical element cool matter absorbing frequency spectrum study line sight velocity cosmic object study chemical composition physical parameter star galaxy nebula star simple object core thermonuclear reaction creating chemical element cool atmosphere it's cool cool term thousand degree colleague infra red astronomy call minus 200 kelvin cool relative 5 000 degree pretty cool spectrum sun 24 000 spectral line 15 percent line identified amazing 21st century properly understand spectrum sun deal tiny weak spectral line measure composition chemical element atmosphere instance spectral line gold spectral line spectrum sun weak feature measure composition gold atmosphere sun work progress dealing similarly weak feature belongs osmium it's heavy element produced thermonuclear explosion supernova it's place produce osmium comparing composition osmium planet host star understand element supernova explosion trigger formation planet star indication day colleague berkeley gibor basri emailed interesting spectrum couldn't sleep week huge amount oxygen element spectrum star knew observed galaxy incredible conclusion make clear evidence supernova explosion system polluted atmosphere star black hole formed binary system mass solar mass considered evidence black hole supernova explosion colleague comparing composition chemical element galactic star discovered alien star galaxy it's amazing simply studying chemical composition star star spectrum alien galaxy interaction galaxy capture star you've heard solar flare surprised discover super flare flare thousand million time powerful sun binary star galaxy called fh leo discovered super flare study spectral star strange object found normal star normal sun age normal mystery it's mystery super flare similar case reported literature ahead understand chemical evolution universe it's complicated don't understand it's show complicated story production chemical element channel massive star low mass star producing recycling matter chemical element universe 14 billion year end picture important graph showing relative abundance chemical element sun star interstellar medium mean it's impossible find object find 10 time sulfur silicon time calcium oxygen it's impossible find related seti naturally can't doppler effect important fundamental physic related change frequency moving source doppler effect discover extrasolar planet precision discover jupiter planet sun star 28 4 meter centimeter detect earth planet future spectrograph i'm involved team developing codex high resolution future generation spectrograph 42 meter e elt telescope instrument detect earth planet sun star amazing tool called astroseismology detect sound wave atmosphere star sound alpha cen detect sound wave atmosphere sun star wave frequency infrasound domain sound domain coming back important question closely related tectonic volcanic activity planet connection life radioactive nucleus straightforward life tectonic activity volcanic activity geothermal energy produced decay uranium thorium potassium measure planet amount element small planet tectonically dead life uranium potassium thorium life imagine boiling it's energy planet measuring abundance thorium star extrasolar planet it's game tiny feature measure profile detect thorium it's tough it's tough convince convince colleague convince world detected atmosphere extrasolar planet host star 100 parsec it's difficult life extrasolar planet job radioactive element system discover alien tune radio telescope listen signal receive interesting that's seti seti year promising biomarkers spectrum earth earthshine spectrum clear signal slope coming call red edge detection vegetated area it's amazing detect vegetation spectrum imagine test planet recently recently i'm talking month water methane carbon dioxide detected spectrum planet solar system it's amazing power spectroscopy detect study chemical composition planet solar system detect oxygen ozone make condition life cosmic miracle related seti imagine object amazing object explain stand give physic doesn't work it's refer seti physic it's pointed frank drake year ago shklovsky spectrum planet host star strange chemical element signal civilization signal signal presence spectral line spectrum star way way instance technetium radioactive element decay time 4 2 million year suddenly observe technetium sun star put element atmosphere natural impossible reviewing spectrum 300 star extrasolar planet job 2000 it's heavy project working hard interesting case candidate thing can't explain hope future confirm main question ufo radio signal spectrum spectrum planet earth showing presence nitrogen dioxide clear signal life oxygen ozone day 15 year 20 year discover spectrum life planet year discover planet earth sun star
