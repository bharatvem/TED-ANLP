computer teenager growing accra cool device play game program basic fascinated library figure thing work read cpu constantly shuffling data back memory ram alu arithmetic logic unit thought cpu work crazy data moving system worried computer introduced million time faster neuron people excited thought outstrip capacity brain quote alan turing 30 year easy computer question person 1946 2007 it's true question aren't kind power computer brain people didn't realize i'm beginning realize pay huge price speed claim big advantage computer let's number blue gene fastest computer world it's 120 000 processor basically process 10 quadrillion bit information that's 10 sixteenth consume half megawatt power great add production capacity tanzania boost economy back state translate amount power electricity computer amount household state 1 200 household u that's power computer let's compare brain picture rory sayres' girlfriend's brain rory graduate student stanford study brain mri claim beautiful brain scanned that's true love computation brain estimate 10 16 bit similar blue gene that's question question similar amount processing similar amount data question energy electricity brain it's laptop computer it's 10 watt computer energy consumed 1 200 house brain energy consumed laptop question brain achieve kind efficiency summarize bottom line brain process information 100 000 time energy computer technology brain let's brain work i'll compare computer work clip pb series secret life brain show cell process information called neuron send pulse electricity process contact pulse electricity jump neuron process called synapse you've huge network cell interacting 100 million sending 10 quadrillion pulse that's basically what's brain you're watching compare computer work computer data central processing unit piece data basically bottleneck brain neuron data flow network connection neuron there's bottleneck it's network literal sense word net work brain picture kind word pop mind serial it's rigid it's car freeway happen lockstep parallel it's fluid information processing dynamic adaptive i'm figure quote brian eno problem computer africa brian 1995 listening people beginning listen there's pressing technological problem face i'll bit slide it's remarkable convergence device compute computer device brain compute device computer what's called transistor electrode called gate control flow current source drain electrode current electrical current carried electron house turn gate increase amount current steady flow current turn gate there's current flowing device computer presence current represent absence current represent what's happening transistor smaller smaller smaller longer behave fact starting behave device neuron compute called ion channel protein molecule neuron thousand sits membrane cell it's pore individual potassium ion flowing pore pore open close it's open ion line flow time kind sporadic steady it's sporadic flow current close pore neuron open close pore generate electrical activity it's closed ion small sneak sneak time pore open current you've zero thrown it's closed thrown starting happen transistor reason that's happening 2007 technology transistor big electron flow channel simultaneously side side fact there's 12 electron flowing mean transistor corresponds 12 ion channel parallel year time 2015 shrink transistor intel adding core chip memory stick carry gigabyte stuff 256 transistor smaller happen technology benefitted what's happening 2015 transistor small corresponds electron time flow channel corresponds single ion channel start kind traffic jam ion channel current turn random it's supposed mean computer zero mixed that's crash machine stage don't compute kind device kind thing thing compute kind device brain computer pick specific item data memory sends processor alu put result back memory that's red path that's highlighted brain work told neuron represent information break data piece represented pulse neuron piece data distributed network process data result translate pattern activity pattern activity flowing network set connection input pattern flow generates output pattern there's redundant connection piece data piece data clobbered doesn't show piece activate missing part redundant connection crappy device doesn't show there's redundancy network recover missing information make brain inherently robust system store data locally it's brittle step flawless lose data brain system store data distributed it's robust basically talk dream build computer work brain we've working couple year i'm show system designed model retina piece brain line inside eyeball didn't writing code computer fact processing piece brain similar kind processing computer stream video internet compress information send what's image eyeball squeeze information optic nerve send rest brain software kind algorithm talked neurobiologist reverse engineered piece brain that's called retina figured cell figured network network blueprint design silicon chip neuron represented node circuit chip connection neuron represented modeled transistor transistor behaving essentially ion channel behave brain give kind robust architecture artificial eye retina chip designed sits lens chip i'm show video silicon retina put output kareem zaghloul who's student designed chip explain you're it's putting kind information it's straightforward camera retina chip extract kind information extract region dark contrast show video red extract region white light contrast show video green kareem's dark eye that's white background extract movement kareem move head blue activity represents region contrast increasing image that's it's dark light yellow activity represents region contrast decreasing it's light dark type information optic nerve million fiber 900 000 fiber send type information duplicating kind signal optic nerve notice snapshot output retina chip sparse doesn't light green background edge hair thing people compress video send make sparse file smaller retina it's circuitry network neuron interacting we've captured chip point make i'll show image i'll show reconstruct image recognize kareem top part that's idea stand light dark contrast it's moving back retina pick that's you're sitting background move eye cell detect change move attention important catching who's sneak end put africa piano steel drum modified that's put africa piano put africa computer kind computer generate thought imagination creative thing chris anderson question kwabena put mind work you're future africa conference connection make kwabena boahen beginning computer teenager growing accra gut reaction wrong brute force inelegant don't would've reaction i'd grown reading science fiction hearing rd2d2 called buying hype computer coming perspective bringing perspective bear problem lot people africa perspective that's impact technology that's impact it's evolve you're
