secret producing extremely drought tolerant crop providing food security world lie resurrection plant pictured extremely droughted state plant dead they're give water resurrect green start growing 12 48 hour suggest producing drought tolerant crop providing food security current world population 7 billion it's estimated 2050 we'll 9 10 billion people bulk growth happening africa food agricultural organization world suggested 70 percent increase current agricultural practice meet demand plant base food chain that's plant percentage 70 percent consideration potential effect climate change study dai published 2011 consideration potential effect climate change expressed thing increased aridity due lack rain infrequent rain area red shown area recently successfully agriculture anymore lack rainfall situation that's predicted happen 2050 africa fact world trouble we're smart way producing food preferably drought tolerant crop thing remember africa agriculture rainfed making drought tolerant crop easiest thing world reason water water essential life planet living actively metabolizing organism microbe comprised predominately water life reaction happen water loss small amount water result death 65 percent water lose percent die make behavioral avoid plant can't they're stuck ground instance bit water 95 percent water lose bit 10 70 percent depending specie short period resist avoid water loss extreme example resistor found succulent tend small attractive hold water great cost grow extremely slowly example avoidance water loss found tree shrub send deep root mine subterranean water supply flushing time keeping hydrated called baobab it's called upside tree simply proportion root shoot great tree planted upside root required hydration plant common strategy avoidance found annual annual make bulk plant food supply west coast country year don't vegetation growth spring rain flowering desert strategy annual grow rainy season end season produce seed dry 10 percent water alive dry alive call desiccation tolerant desiccated state seed lie extreme environment prolonged period time time rainy season germinate grow cycle start it's widely believed evolution desiccation tolerant seed allowed colonization radiation flowering plant angiosperm land back annual major form food supply wheat rice maize form 95 percent plant food supply it's great strategy short space time produce lot seed seed energy rich there's lot food calorie store time plenty time famine there's downside vegetative tissue root leaf annual inherent resistance avoidance tolerance characteristic don't grow rainy season they've seed survive rest year concerted effort agriculture make crop improved property resistance avoidance tolerance resistance avoidance we've good model understand work image maize crop africa week rain it's dead solution resurrection plant plant lose 95 percent cellular water remain dry dead state month year give water green start growing seed desiccation tolerant seed withstand extreme environmental condition rare phenomenon 135 flowering plant specie i'm show video resurrection process specie order bottom there's time axis quickly pretty amazing huh i've spent 21 year understand plant dry dying work variety resurrection plant shown hydrated dry state number reason plant serf model crop i'd make drought tolerant extreme top left grass it's called eragrostis nindensis it's close relative called eragrostis tef lot teff it's staple food ethiopia it's gluten free it's make drought tolerant reason number plant initially wanted find thing mechanism lose water die undertook call system biology approach order comprehensive understanding desiccation tolerance molecular plant ecophysiological level thing plant anatomy dried ultrastructure transcriptome term technology gene switched response drying gene code protein proteome protein made response drying protein code enzyme make metabolite metabolome important plant stuck ground call highly tuned chemical arsenal protect stress environment it's important chemical involved drying study molecular level lipidome lipid response drying that's important biological membrane made lipid they're held membrane they're water water membrane fall lipid act signal turn gene physiological biochemical study understand function putative protectants we've discovered study understand plant cope natural environment i've philosophy needed comprehensive understanding mechanism desiccation tolerance order make meaningful suggestion biotic application i'm thinking biotic application she's make genetically modified crop answer question depends definition genetic modification crop eat today wheat rice maize highly genetically modified ancestor don't gm they're produced conventional breeding put resurrection plant gene crop answer essence time approach appropriately collaborator uct jennifer thomson suhail rafudeen spearheaded approach i'm show data we're embark extremely ambitious approach aim turn suite gene present crop they're turned extreme drought condition leave decide called gm i'm give data approach order explain bit gene work gene made double stranded dna it's wound tightly chromosome present cell body plant's body unwind dna gene gene promoter switch gene coding region terminator end gene gene start promoter simple switch require lot fine tuning lot thing present correct gene switched what's typically biotech study inducible promoter switch couple gene interest put plant plant responds study i'm talk collaborator drought induced promoter discovered resurrection plant nice thing promoter plant sens drought we've drive antioxidant gene resurrection plant antioxidant gene stress drought stress result formation free radical reactive oxygen specie highly damaging crop death antioxidant stop damage here's data maize strain that's popularly africa left arrow plant gene plant antioxidant gene week watering gene hell lot final approach research shown there's considerable similarity mechanism desiccation tolerance seed resurrection plant question gene slightly differently phrased resurrection plant gene evolved seed desiccation tolerance root leaf retasked seed gene root leaf resurrection plant answer question consequence lot research group recent collaboration group henk hilhorst netherlands mel oliver united state julia buitink france answer core set gene involved i'm illustrate crudely maize chromosome switch represent gene required desiccation tolerance maize seed dried end period development switch gene resurrection plant switch gene dry modern crop gene root leaf switch switch seed tissue we're understand environmental cellular signal switch gene resurrection plant mimic process crop final thought we're rapidly repeat nature evolution resurrection plant 10 40 million year ago plant attention
