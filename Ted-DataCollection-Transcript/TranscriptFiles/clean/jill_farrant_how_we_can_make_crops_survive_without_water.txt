secret producing extremely drought tolerant crop providing food security world lie resurrection plant pictured extremely droughted state plant dead give water resurrect green start growing 12 48 hour suggest producing drought tolerant crop providing food security current world population 7 billion estimated 2050 9 10 billion people bulk growth happening africa food agricultural organization world suggested 70 percent increase current agricultural practice meet demand plant base food chain plant percentage 70 percent consideration potential effect climate change study dai published 2011 consideration potential effect climate change expressed thing increased aridity due lack rain infrequent rain area red shown area recently successfully agriculture anymore lack rainfall situation predicted happen 2050 africa fact world trouble smart way producing food preferably drought tolerant crop thing remember africa agriculture rainfed making drought tolerant crop easiest thing world reason water water essential life planet living actively metabolizing organism microbe comprised predominately water life reaction happen water loss small amount water result death 65 percent water lose percent die make behavioral avoid plant stuck ground instance bit water 95 percent water lose bit 10 70 percent depending specie short period resist avoid water loss extreme example resistor found succulent tend small attractive hold water great cost grow extremely slowly example avoidance water loss found tree shrub send deep root mine subterranean water supply flushing time keeping hydrated called baobab called upside tree simply proportion root shoot great tree planted upside root required hydration plant common strategy avoidance found annual annual make bulk plant food supply west coast country year vegetation growth spring rain flowering desert strategy annual grow rainy season end season produce seed dry 10 percent water alive dry alive call desiccation tolerant desiccated state seed lie extreme environment prolonged period time time rainy season germinate grow cycle start widely believed evolution desiccation tolerant seed allowed colonization radiation flowering plant angiosperm land back annual major form food supply wheat rice maize form 95 percent plant food supply great strategy short space time produce lot seed seed energy rich lot food calorie store time plenty time famine downside vegetative tissue root leaf annual inherent resistance avoidance tolerance characteristic grow rainy season seed survive rest year concerted effort agriculture make crop improved property resistance avoidance tolerance resistance avoidance good model understand work image maize crop africa week rain dead solution resurrection plant plant lose 95 percent cellular water remain dry dead state month year give water green start growing seed desiccation tolerant seed withstand extreme environmental condition rare phenomenon 135 flowering plant specie show
