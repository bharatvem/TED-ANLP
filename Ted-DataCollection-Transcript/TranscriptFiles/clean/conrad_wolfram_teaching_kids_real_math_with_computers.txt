we've real problem math education basically one's happy learning it's disconnected uninteresting hard employ don't government realize it's big deal economy don't fix teacher frustrated math important world point human history end we've falling interest education math end we've mathematical world quantitative world what's problem chasm opened fix answer staring face computer correctly computer silver bullet making math education work explain talk bit math real world education real world math isn't necessarily mathematician it's geologist engineer biologist sort people modeling simulation it's popular education dumbed problem lot calculating hand lot thing simple difficult real world you're learning thing math math math doesn't drunk answer that's quantitative modern world wouldn't expected year back find weight higher let's zoom bit teaching people math what's point teaching people math teaching math general important part education sort compulsory subject reason technical job critical development economy call everyday living function world today you've pretty quantitative year ago figure mortgage skeptical government statistic kind thing thirdly call logical mind training logical thinking year we've put society process logically it's part human society it's important learn math great let's question math we're math educating people math it's step roughly speaking starting posing question we're find thing screwed world virtually part math people wrong question surprisingly wrong answer reason thing problem turn real world problem math problem that's stage you've there's computation step turn answer mathematical form math powerful finally turn back real world answer question verify crucial step here's crazy thing math education we're spending 80 percent time teaching people step hand that's step computer human year practice computer step student spend effort learning step conceptualizing problem applying teacher run crucial point math equal calculating math broader subject calculating it's understandable intertwined hundred year calculating hand decade totally changed we've biggest transformation ancient subject imagine computer calculating typically limiting step isn't term fact math liberated calculating math liberation didn't education calculating sense machinery math it's chore it's thing you'd avoid machine it's mean end end automation machinery computer small problem mean estimated today world spent 106 average world lifetime teaching people calculate hand that's amazing amount human endeavor damn didn't fun damn we're real purpose assuming computer calculating hand calculation make sense teach people case mental arithmetic lot estimating people true i'll hmm i'll roughly it's quicker practical practicality case it's worth teaching people hand conceptual thing benefit hand calculating they're small number thing ancient greek relates thing we're we're forcing people learn mathematics it's major subject i'm minute suggesting people interested hand calculating interest subject bizarre that's absolutely thing people follow interest interested ancient greek don't force entire population learn subject ancient greek don't it's warranted distinction we're making people subject that's sort mainstream subject sense people follow interest spiked issue people bring basic shouldn't machine basic subject usual question basic basic basic driving car learning service design matter basic writing learning sharpen quill don't separate basic you're machinery automation make separation hundred year ago it's true drive car kind needed lot mechanic car ignition timing worked sort thing automation car allowed separate driving separate subject speak engineering car learning service automation separation case driving future case math democratized spread larger number people work there's thing basic people confuse view order invention tool order teaching paper invented computer doesn't necessarily basic subject paper computer teach mathematics daughter gave nice anecdote enjoys making call paper laptop asked day age didn't make carefully reflecting paper born computer paper doesn't matter order you're taught tool computer dumb math computer it's mindless button pushing hand it's intellectual kind annoys math people school practically today applying procedure problem don't understand reason don't don't what's worse they're learning isn't practically anymore 50 year ago isn't anymore they're education computer clear computer problem make conceptual great tool completely mindlessly turning multimedia show shown solving equation hand computer teacher show student manipulate solve hand nut computer show student solve problem hand computer backwards show make problem harder calculate school thing solve quadratic equation you're computer substitute make quartic equation make kind harder calculating wise principle applied calculation harder problem real world nutty horrible they've hair they're simple dumbed thing school math world engineering biology thing benefited computer math conceptually reduced computer don't opposite problem we've math education computer dumb dumbed problem issue people bring hand calculating procedure teach understanding lot example answer understand basic system work thing valid understanding procedure process important there's fantastic modern world it's called programming programming procedure process written day it's great engage student check understand check understand math write program programming clear suggesting unique opportunity make math practical conceptual simultaneously can't subject that's recently it's kind choice vocational intellectual time open possibility problem gain student intuition experience greater quantity they've experience harder problem play math interact feel people feel math instinctively that's computer thing reorder curriculum traditionally it's difficult calculate reorder difficult understand concept hard calculating calculus traditionally taught late it's damn hard calculation that's problem concept amenable younger age group built daughter simple talking increase number side polygon large number turn circle insistent change color important feature demonstration early step limit differential calculus thing extreme small side large number side simple that's view world don't give people year that's important practical view world roadblock moving agenda forward exam end test hand exam it's kind hard curriculum changed point computer semester reason it's important it's important computer exam question real question question what's life insurance policy real question people everyday life isn't dumbed model actual model asked optimize year protection payment interest rate i'm minute suggesting it's kind question asked exam it's important type completely critical people's real understanding critical reform computer based math make move economy forward society based idea people feel mathematics isn't optional extra country view leapfrog achieving economy improved economy improved outlook fact talk moving call knowledge economy call computational knowledge economy high level math integral knowledge engage student time let's understand incremental sort change we're cross chasm school math real world math walk chasm end making worse didn't start bigger disaster i'm suggesting leap increase velocity it's high leap side calculated differential equation carefully completely renewed changed math curriculum built ground based computer computer ubiquitous calculating machine completely small number year i'm brand subject math it's mainstream subject future let's we're let's bit fun student ted
