observe can't basic question who's interested finding studying black hole black hole object pull gravity intense escape light can't directly story today black hole black hole i'm interested finding massive call supermassive black hole center galaxy reason interesting opportunity prove exotic object exist opportunity understand supermassive black hole interact environment understand affect formation evolution galaxy reside begin understand black hole understand proof black hole black hole way black hole incredibly simple object characteristic describe mass spin charge i'm talk mass sense it's simple object sense it's incredibly complicated object exotic physic describe sense represents breakdown physical understanding universe today understand black hole proof black hole object mass confined volume fact i'm talk object that's supermassive i'm mean moment finite size tricky fortunately finite size that's schwarzschild radius that's named guy recognized important radius virtual radius reality black hole size important it's important tell object black hole mean neighbor cellphone auditorium black hole figure compress size schwarzschild radius point what's happen point gravity win gravity win force object forced continue collapse infinitely small object it's black hole compress earth size sugar cube black hole size sugar cube schwarzschild radius key figure schwarzschild radius turn it's pretty simple figure depends mass object bigger object bigger schwarzschild radius smaller object smaller schwarzschild radius sun compress scale university oxford black hole schwarzschild radius it's concept tell black hole form key element proof black hole thing understand mass object i'm claiming black hole schwarzschild radius mass determines schwarzschild radius thing job convincing black hole show object that's confined schwarzschild radius job today skeptical i'm talk ordinary black hole i'm talk supermassive black hole wanted word ordinary black hole thing ordinary black hole ordinary black hole thought end state massive star's life star start life mass mass sun it's end life exploding leaving beautiful supernova remnant inside supernova remnant black hole mass roughly time mass sun astronomical scale that's small black hole talk supermassive black hole supermassive black hole thought reside center galaxy beautiful picture hubble space telescope show galaxy shape size big object picture galaxy nice spiral upper left hundred billion star galaxy give sense scale light typical galaxy kind galaxy we're light star galaxy star light exotic galaxy call prima donna galaxy world kind show offs call active galactic nucleus call nucleus center active center that's starlight light can't explained starlight it's energetic fact example it's we're jet emanating center source energy that's difficult explain galaxy composed star people thought supermassive black hole matter falling can't black hole convert gravitational energy black hole light thought supermassive black hole exist center galaxy it's kind indirect argument nonetheless it's rise notion it's prima donna supermassive black hole galaxy harbor supermassive black hole center that's case normal galaxy star light supermassive black hole assume it's black hole diet suppress energetic phenomenon active galactic nucleus we're stealth black hole center galaxy place galaxy milky wide field picture center milky line star live galaxy flattened disk structure live middle center plane defines plane galaxy line defines plane galaxy advantage studying galaxy it's simply closest center galaxy we're closest galaxy 100 time detail galaxy anyplace you'll moment ability detail key experiment astronomer prove lot mass inside small volume job show today tool watch star orbit black hole star orbit black hole planet orbit sun it's gravitational pull make thing orbit massive object thing flying slower rate determines mass inside orbit great remember job show lot mass inside small volume fast mass scale orbit radius star close center galaxy show mass inside small region mean lot detail that's reason experiment we've world's largest telescope keck observatory host telescope mirror 10 meter roughly diameter tennis court wonderful campaign promise large telescope bigger telescope smaller detail turn telescope telescope ground bit challenge living campaign promise atmosphere atmosphere great survive earth it's challenging astronomer atmosphere astronomical source give sense it's pebble bottom stream pebble bottom stream stream continuously moving turbulent make difficult pebble bottom stream it's difficult astronomical source atmosphere that's continuously moving i've spent lot career working way correct atmosphere give cleaner view buy factor 20 agree figure improve life factor 20 you've improved lifestyle lot salary you'd notice kid you'd notice animation show technique called adaptive optic you're animation don't technique word picture show star box centered center galaxy black hole technology can't star technology sudden technology work introducing mirror telescope optic system that's continuously changing counteract atmosphere it's kind fancy eyeglass telescope slide i'm focus square we're star inside small square we've looked thing moved experiment star moved tremendous amount we've experiment 15 year star astronomer favorite star mine today star that's labeled 2 absolutely favorite star world that's 15 year give sense short sun take 200 million year center galaxy star knew close center galaxy 500 year human lifetime that's kind profound it's key experiment orbit tell mass inside small radius picture show experiment size confine mass center galaxy knew million time mass sun inside circle lot stuff inside circle lot star lot alternative idea supermassive black hole center galaxy put lot stuff experiment we've confined mass smaller volume that's 10 000 time smaller we've show supermassive black hole give sense small size that's size solar system we're cramming million time mass sun small volume truth advertising told job schwarzchild radius truth i'm alternative today explaining concentration mass fact it's evidence date existence supermassive black hole center galaxy universe good we're today's technology let's move problem briefly example excitement today center galaxy supermassive black hole fun phase experiment we've tested idea consequence supermassive black hole center galaxy single inconsistent that's fun give example expect star star center galaxy long time they've plenty time interact black hole expect star clustered black hole lot star black hole likewise young star contrast young star black hole make kind neighbor stellar nursery star form big ball gas dust collapse it's fragile entity big black hole strip gas cloud pull stronger side cloud stripped fact anticipated star formation shouldn't proceed environment shouldn't young star observation i've shown today figure young red young blue yellow don't surprise dearth star abundance young star it's exact opposite prediction fun part fact today we're figure mystery resolve contradiction fact graduate student moment today telescope hawaii making observation stage address question young star star make progress orbit star we'll sophisticated technology today truth we're correcting earth's atmosphere correct half error introduced shooting laser atmosphere shine correct rest hope year longer time scale hope build larger telescope remember bigger astronomy build 30 meter telescope telescope star closer center galaxy hope test einstein's theory general relativity idea cosmology galaxy form future experiment exciting conclusion i'm show animation basically show orbit moving dimension hope i've convinced fact supermassive black hole center galaxy mean thing exist universe contend explain object physical world we've interaction supermassive black hole interact understand role play shaping galaxy work happened advent tremendous progress that's made technology front field moving incredibly fast hold lot store future
