i'd introduce emerging area science speculative hugely exciting that's growing rapidly quantum biology asks simple question quantum mechanic weird wonderful powerful theory subatomic world atom molecule underpins modern physic chemistry play role inside living cell word process mechanism phenomenon living organism explained helping hand quantum mechanic quantum biology isn't it's early 1930s it's decade careful experiment biochemistry lab spectroscopy shown clear firm evidence specific mechanism require quantum mechanic explain quantum biology brings quantum physicist biochemist molecular biologist it's interdisciplinary field quantum physic i'm nuclear physicist i've spent decade head quantum mechanic founder quantum mechanic niels bohr you're astonished haven't understood sort feel happy i'm astonished that's good thing mean study smallest structure universe building block reality scale size start everyday object tennis ball order magnitude size eye needle cell bacterium enzyme eventually reach nano world nanotechnology term you've heard nanometer billionth meter area atomic nucleus tiny dot inside atom it's smaller scale domain quantum mechanic physicist chemist long time biologist hand lightly view happy ball stick model molecule ball atom stick bond atom can't build physically lab nowadays powerful computer simulate huge molecule protein made 100 000 atom doesn't require quantum mechanic explain quantum mechanic developed 1920s set beautiful powerful mathematical rule idea explain world small it's world that's everyday world made trillion atom it's world built probability chance it's fuzzy world it's world phantom particle behave spread wave imagine quantum mechanic quantum physic fundamental foundation reality it's surprising quantum physic underpins organic chemistry rule atom fit make organic molecule organic chemistry scaled complexity molecular biology lead life it's sort surprising it's trivial life ultimately depend quantum mechanic inanimate matter made trillion atom ultimately there's quantum level delve weirdness everyday life forget put trillion atom quantum weirdness dissolve quantum biology isn't quantum biology isn't obvious quantum mechanic underpins life molecular level quantum biology trivial counterintuitive idea quantum mechanic play important role describing process life perfect counterintuitiveness quantum world quantum skier intact perfectly healthy side tree time track you'd guess sort stunt quantum world time particle multitask place thing time particle behave spread wave it's magic physicist chemist century weirdness don't blame biologist wanting learn quantum mechanic weirdness delicate physicist work hard maintain lab cool system absolute carry experiment vacuum isolate external disturbance that's warm messy noisy environment living cell biology molecular biology describing process life term chemistry chemical reaction reductionist deterministic chemical reaction showing essentially life made stuff forget quantum mechanic macro world forget biology man begged differ idea erwin schrödinger schrödinger's cat fame austrian physicist founder quantum mechanic 1920s 1944 wrote book called life tremendously influential influenced francis crick james watson discoverer double helix structure dna paraphrase description book molecular level living organism order structure that's random thermodynamic jostling atom molecule inanimate matter complexity fact living matter behave order structure inanimate matter cooled absolute quantum effect play important role there's special structure order inside living cell schrödinger speculated quantum mechanic play role life it's speculative reaching idea didn't mentioned start 10 year experiment emerging showing phenomenon biology require quantum mechanic share exciting phenomenon quantum world quantum tunneling box left show wavelike spread distribution quantum entity particle electron ball bouncing wall it's wave probability permeate solid wall phantom leaping side faint smudge light hand box quantum tunneling suggests particle hit impenetrable barrier magic disappear side reappear nicest explaining throw ball wall give energy top wall quantum world don't throw wall throw wall there's probability it'll disappear side reappear isn't speculation we're happy happy word familiar quantum tunneling take place time fact it's reason sun shine particle fuse sun turn hydrogen helium quantum tunneling back 70 80 discovered quantum tunneling take place inside living cell enzyme workhorse life catalyst chemical reaction enzyme biomolecules speed chemical reaction living cell order magnitude it's mystery discovered trick enzyme evolved make transferring subatomic particle electron proton part molecule quantum tunneling it's efficient it's fast disappear proton disappear place reappear enzyme place research that's carried back 80 group berkeley judith klinman group uk confirmed enzyme research carried group mentioned i'm nuclear physicist i've realized i've tool quantum mechanic atomic nucleus apply tool area question asked quantum tunneling play role mutation dna idea back early 60 strand dna double helix structure held rung it's twisted ladder rung ladder hydrogen bond proton act glue strand zoom they're holding large molecule nucleotide zoom bit computer simulation white ball middle proton it's double hydrogen bond prefers sit side side strand vertical line can't happen proton hop watch white ball jump side strand dna separate leading process replication proton wrong position lead mutation half century question jump ball wall quantum tunnel don't energy early indication suggest quantum tunneling play role don't important open question it's speculative it's question important quantum mechanic play role mutation surely big implication understand type mutation possibly lead turning cell cancerous quantum mechanic biology quantum coherence important process biology photosynthesis plant bacteria taking sunlight energy create biomass quantum coherence idea quantum entity multitasking it's quantum skier it's object behaves wave doesn't move direction follow multiple pathway time year ago world science shocked paper published showing experimental evidence quantum coherence take place inside bacteria carrying photosynthesis idea photon particle light sunlight quantum light captured chlorophyll molecule delivered what's called reaction center turned chemical energy doesn't follow route multiple pathway optimize efficient reaching reaction center dissipating waste heat quantum coherence taking place inside living cell remarkable idea evidence growing weekly paper coming confirming place final beautiful wonderful idea it's speculative share european robin migrates scandinavia mediterranean autumn lot marine animal insect navigate sensing earth's magnetic field earth's magnetic field weak it's 100 time weaker fridge magnet affect chemistry living organism that's doubt german couple ornithologist wolfgang roswitha wiltschko 1970s confirmed robin find sensing earth's magnetic field give directional information built compass puzzle mystery theory town don't it's correct theory theory town called quantum entanglement inside robin's retina kid inside robin's retina protein called cryptochrome light sensitive cryptochrome pair electron quantum entangled quantum entanglement particle remain contact einstein hated idea called spooky action distance einstein doesn't uncomfortable quantum entangled electron single molecule dance delicate dance sensitive direction bird fly earth's magnetic field don't it's correct explanation wow wouldn't exciting quantum mechanic help bird navigate quantum biology infancy it's speculative it's built solid science coming decade we're start pervades life life evolved trick utilize quantum world watch space
