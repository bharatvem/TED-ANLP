autopilot unit tiny computer gps compass barometric altimeter sensor drone meant carry payload video camera photographic camera requires software user program mission drone people talk surprised hear component make conservation drone surprised affordable component fact conservation drone doesn't cost good laptop computer decent pair binoculars you've built conservation drone fly fly drone don't drone fly program mission drone fly simply clicking point google map interface open source software mission simple point slightly longer complicated fly river system fly drone lawnmower type pattern picture area picture processed produce map forest researcher fly drone boundary forest watch poacher people enter forest illegally mission you've programmed simply upload autopilot system bring drone

prototype drone main objective fly remote rainforest north sumatra indonesia nest specie great ape orangutan reason wanted needed individual specie left forest traditional method surveying orangutan walk forest foot carrying heavy equipment pair binoculars treetop find orangutan nest imagine time consuming labor intensive costly process hoping drone significantly reduce cost surveying orangutan population indonesia southeast asia excited captured pair orangutan nest camera picture orangutan nest drone picture dozen nest part southeast asia we're working computer scientist develop algorithm automatically count number nest thousand photo we've collected nest object drone detect wild orangutan happily feeding top palm tree seemingly oblivious drone flying overhead time we've picture animal

exciting part taking picture air stitch picture special software create map entire landscape map crucial information monitoring land change plantation expanding forest contracting fire breaking aerial image processed produce dimensional computer model forest model visually appealing geometrically accurate mean researcher measure distance tree calculate surface area volume vegetation important information monitoring health forest recently we've begun experimenting thermal imaging camera camera detect heat emitting object ground detecting poacher campfire night i've told lot conservation drone operate drone drone conservation drone world built prototype drone switzerland brought indonesia test flight we've building drone collaborator world include fellow biologist partner major conservation organization rewarding part working collaborator feedback give improve drone building drone constant work progress constantly improve term range ruggedness amount payload carry work

forest retrieve image take lot time dozen hundred camera forest drone designed perform task efficiently drone carrying special sensor flown forest remotely download image wi fi enabled camera radio collar tool that's commonly biologist collar put animal transmit radio signal researcher track movement animal landscape traditional tracking animal pretty ridiculous requires researcher walking ground carrying huge cumbersome radio antenna unlike tv antenna rooftop drone job efficiently equip drone scanning radio receiver fly forest canopy pattern user operator triangulate location radio collared animal remotely step foot forest exciting drone fly remote explored rainforest hidden tropic parachute tiny spy microphone eavesdrop call mammal bird amphibian yeti sasquatch bigfoot give biologist pretty good idea animal living forest finally show latest version conservation drone maja drone wingspan meter weighs kilogram carry half weight fully autonomous system mission transmit live video feed back ground station laptop user drone real time carry variety sensor photo quality sensor high centimeter pixel drone stay air 40 60 minute range 50 kilometer sufficient conservation application conservation drone began crazy idea biologist deeply passionate technology strongly drone game changer conservation research application we've fair share skeptic critic thought fooling toy plane let's honest drone ultimate toy boy time we've wonderful colleague collaborator share vision potential conservation drone obvious conservation biologist practitioner make full tool including
