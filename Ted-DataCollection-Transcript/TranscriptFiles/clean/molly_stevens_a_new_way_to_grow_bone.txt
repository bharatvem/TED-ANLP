human it's nature improve health minimize suffering life throw it's cancer diabetes heart disease broken bone i'm head biomaterials lab i'm fascinated human material creative way body time beautiful blue nacre shell mayan artificial tooth replacement we're it's hard it's durable nice property fact put jawbone integrate jaw sophisticated imaging technology part integration fact material designed specific beautiful chemistry beautiful architecture way sort blue nacre shell mayan real application bluetooth technology move history people material body it's physician creative they've thing shelf favorite example sir harold ridley famous ophthalmologist famous ophthalmologist world war ii pilot coming back mission noticed eye shard small bit material lodged eye interesting thing material wasn't causing inflammatory response looked figured material shard plastic coming canopy spitfire led propose material material intraocular lens it's called pmma it's million people year help preventing cataract nice help remind early day people chose material bioinert purpose perform mechanical function you'd put body wouldn't adverse response show regenerative medicine we've shifted idea taking bioinert material we're actively material bioactive interact body put body they'll function they'll dissolve time schematic showing typical tissue engineering approach cell typically patient put material make material complex grow lab put straight back patient approach that's world including lab thing that's important we're thinking stem cell stem cell thing thing make environment put information sort specialist tissue type tissue people regenerating world lab world there's pretty tissue structure tissue it's depend patient underlying disease condition term you're regenerate tissue you're material you're carefully biochemistry mechanic property tissue ability regenerate poor prometheus made tricky career choice punished greek god tied rock eagle day eat liver liver regenerate day day day punished eternity god liver regenerate nice tissue cartilage simplest nick you're find difficult regenerate cartilage it's tissue tissue bone tissue work lot lab bone good repairing we've fracture point way repairing fracture procedure called iliac crest harvest surgeon bone iliac crest transplant body work it's bone it's vascularized mean it's good blood supply problem there's operation patient significant pain defect site year operation thinking there's tremendous bone repair iliac crest type approach lot limitation recreate generation bone body demand transplant painful aftereffect iliac crest harvest coming back typical tissue engineering approach thinking differently simplified lot rid lot step rid harvest cell patient rid put fancy chemistry rid culture scaffold lab focused material system making simple clever generate enormous amount bone approach body catalyst make lot bone it's approach call vivo bioreactor make enormous amount bone approach i'll talk human layer stem cell long bone layer called periosteum layer tightly bound underlying bone it's stem cell stem cell important embryo develops sort wake fracture repairing bone periosteum layer developed inject underneath liquid 30 second turn rigid gel lift periosteum bone creates essence artificial cavity bone rich layer stem cell pinhole incision cell body artificial vivo bioreactor cavity lead proliferation stem cell form lot tissue time harvest tissue body histology slide essentially large amount bone picture middle leg bone marrow original bone original bone finish left bone that's grown bioreactor cavity make larger demarcation original bone bone act slight point weakness surgeon harvest bone periosteum grow back you're left leg sort state hadn't operated place it's low term pain compared iliac crest harvest grow amount bone depending gel put demand sort procedure time received lot attention press nice generating bone contact people interested i'm contact strange slightly unexpected interesting put contact team american footballer wanted double thickness skull made head kind contact british growing france tend blunt explain nicely case wasn't protect place approach simple material thought carefully cell body embryo develop form kind tissue cartilage developed gel slightly nature slightly chemistry put 100 percent cartilage approach work pre planned procedure it's pre plan kind operation there's scaffold based approach designing scaffold multi disciplinary team team chemist cell biologist surgeon physicist people hard designing material make information cell complex make difficult clinic thing lot understand structure tissue body bone favorite tissue zoom don't bone structure it's beautifully organized beautifully organized we've lot blood vessel zoom cell surrounded 3d matrix nano scale fiber give lot information cell zoom case bone matrix cell beautifully organized nano scale it's hybrid material that's part organic part inorganic that's led field looked developing material hybrid kind structure i'm showing example we've made material sort structure tailor squishy material that's hybrid sort material remarkable toughness it's longer brittle inorganic material brittle wouldn't sort strength toughness thing quickly mention scaffold make porous blood vessel grow pore oftentimes bigger cell it's 3d cell slightly curved surface that's bit unnatural thing making scaffold slightly dimension surround cell 3d give bit information there's lot work area finally talk bit applying sort thing cardiovascular disease big clinical problem thing heart attack tissue start die outcome good time great stop dead tissue dying regenerate there's lot lot stem cell trial worldwide type cell common theme coming cell die you've implanted put heart blood system don't number cell location deliver sort beautiful cell regeneration good clinical outcome thing we're thinking people field thinking developing material there's difference chemistry mechanic interesting topography interesting way surround cell cell material that's conductive cell respond conduct signal beating synchronously material that's exciting development that's wrap i'd work sort field work field that's super exciting science potential impact patient big small great privilege i'd
