bone good repairing fracture point way repairing fracture procedure called iliac crest harvest surgeon bone iliac crest transplant body work bone vascularized mean good blood supply problem operation patient significant pain defect site year operation thinking tremendous bone repair iliac crest type approach lot limitation recreate generation bone body demand transplant painful aftereffect iliac crest harvest coming back typical tissue engineering approach thinking differently simplified lot rid lot step rid harvest cell patient rid put fancy chemistry rid culture scaffold lab focused material system making simple clever generate enormous amount bone approach body catalyst make lot bone approach call vivo bioreactor make enormous amount bone approach talk human layer stem cell long bone layer called periosteum layer tightly bound underlying bone stem cell stem cell important embryo develops sort wake fracture repairing bone periosteum layer developed inject underneath liquid 30

lot tissue time harvest tissue body histology slide essentially large amount bone picture middle leg bone marrow original bone original bone finish left bone grown bioreactor cavity make larger demarcation original bone bone act slight point weakness surgeon harvest bone periosteum grow back left leg sort state operated place low term pain compared iliac crest harvest grow amount bone depending gel put demand sort procedure time received lot attention press nice generating bone contact people interested contact strange slightly unexpected interesting put contact team american footballer wanted double thickness skull made head kind contact british growing france tend blunt explain nicely case protect place approach simple material thought carefully cell body embryo develop

scaffold multi disciplinary team team chemist cell biologist surgeon physicist people hard designing material make information cell complex make difficult clinic thing lot understand structure tissue body bone favorite tissue zoom bone structure beautifully organized beautifully organized lot blood vessel zoom cell surrounded 3d matrix nano scale fiber give lot information cell zoom case bone matrix cell beautifully organized nano scale hybrid material part organic part inorganic led field looked developing material hybrid kind structure showing example made material sort structure tailor squishy material hybrid sort material remarkable toughness longer brittle inorganic material brittle sort strength toughness thing quickly mention scaffold make porous blood vessel grow pore oftentimes bigger cell 3d cell slightly curved surface bit unnatural thing making scaffold slightly dimension surround cell 3d give bit information lot work area finally talk bit applying sort thing cardiovascular disease big clinical problem thing heart attack tissue start die outcome good time great stop dead tissue dying regenerate lot lot stem cell trial worldwide type cell common theme coming cell die implanted put heart blood system number cell location deliver sort beautiful cell regeneration good clinical outcome thing thinking people field thinking developing material difference
