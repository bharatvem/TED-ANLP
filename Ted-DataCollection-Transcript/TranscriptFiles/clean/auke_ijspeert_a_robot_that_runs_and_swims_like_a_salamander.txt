pleurobot pleurobot robot designed closely mimic salamander specie called pleurodeles waltl pleurobot walk you'll swim design robot fact robot designed scientific tool neuroscience designed neurobiologist understand animal move spinal cord control locomotion work biorobotics i'm impressed animal locomotion dolphin swimming cat running jumping human jogging play tennis amazing thing fact nervous system solves complex control problem coordinate 200 muscle perfectly coordination bad fall bad locomotion goal understand work main component animal locomotion component body fact underestimate extent biomechanics simplify locomotion animal spinal cord spinal cord find reflex multiple reflex create sensorimotor coordination loop neural activity spinal cord mechanical activity component central pattern generator interesting circuit spinal cord vertebrate animal generate coordinated rhythmic pattern activity receiving simple input signal input signal coming descending modulation higher part brain motor cortex cerebellum basal ganglion modulate activity spinal cord locomotion what's interesting extent low level component spinal cord body solve big part locomotion problem fact cut head chicken run showing lower part spinal cord body solve big part locomotion understanding work complex recording activity spinal cord difficult it's easier implant electrode motor cortex spinal cord it's protected vertebra human hard difficulty locomotion due complex dynamic interaction component it's hard find what's role time biorobots pleurobot mathematical model what's biorobotics biorobotics active field research robotics people inspiration animal make robot outdoors service robot search rescue robot field robot big goal inspiration animal make robot handle complex terrain stair mountain forest place robot difficulty animal job robot wonderful scientific tool nice project robot scientific tool neuroscience biomechanics hydrodynamics purpose pleurobot lab collaborate neurobiologist jean marie cabelguen neurobiologist bordeaux france make spinal cord model validate robot start simple it's good start simple animal lamprey primitive fish gradually complex locomotion salamander cat human mammal robot interesting tool validate model fact pleurobot kind dream true 20 year ago working computer making simulation lamprey salamander locomotion phd knew simulation approximation simulating physic water mud complex ground it's hard simulate properly computer real robot real physic animal favorite salamander it's amphibian it's key animal evolutionary point view make wonderful link swimming find eel fish quadruped locomotion mammal cat human fact modern salamander close terrestrial vertebrate it's living fossil access ancestor ancestor terrestrial tetrapod salamander swim what's called anguilliform swimming gait propagate nice traveling wave muscle activity head tail place salamander ground switch what's called walking trot gait case nice periodic activation limb nicely coordinated standing wave undulation body that's gait pleurobot thing surprising fascinating fact fact generated spinal cord body decerebrated salamander it's nice remove head electrically stimulate spinal cord low level stimulation induce walking gait stimulate bit gait accelerates point there's threshold automatically animal switch swimming amazing changing global drive pressing gas pedal descending modulation spinal cord make complete switch gait fact observed cat stimulate spinal cord cat switch walk trot gallop bird make bird switch walking low level stimulation flapping wing high level stimulation show spinal cord sophisticated locomotion controller studied salamander locomotion detail fact access nice x ray video machine professor martin fischer jena university germany amazing machine record bone motion great detail that's basically figured bone important collected motion 3d collect database motion ground water collect database motor behavior real animal job roboticists replicate robot optimization process find structure place motor connect replay motion pleurobot life let's close real animal direct comparison walking real animal pleurobot exact replay walking gait backwards slowly swimming dry suit put robot water start replaying swimming gait happy difficult physic interaction complex robot bigger small animal what's called dynamic scaling frequency make interaction physic end close match happy let's spinal cord jean marie cabelguen model spinal cord circuit what's interesting salamander primitive circuit similar find lamprey primitive eel fish evolution neural oscillator added control limb leg locomotion neural oscillator make mathematical model coupled transition gait tested board robot previous version pleurobot that's completely controlled spinal cord model programmed board robot thing send robot remote control descending signal receive upper part brain what's interesting playing signal completely control speed heading type gait instance stimulate low level walking gait point stimulate lot rapidly switch swimming gait finally turning nicely stimulating side spinal cord it's beautiful nature distributed control give lot responsibility spinal cord upper part brain doesn't worry muscle worry high level modulation it's job spinal cord coordinate muscle let's cat locomotion importance biomechanics project studied cat biomechanics wanted morphology help locomotion found important criterion property basically limb cat limb pantograph structure pantograph mechanical structure upper segment lower segment parallel simple geometrical system kind coordinate bit internal movement segment property cat limb lightweight muscle trunk good idea limb low inertia moved rapidly final important property elastic behavior cat limb handle impact force designed cheetah cub let's invite cheetah cub onstage peter eckert phd robot it's cute robot bit toy scientific tool investigate property leg cat it's compliant lightweight elastic easily press break jump fact elastic property important bit property segment leg pantograph what's interesting dynamic gait obtained purely open loop meaning sensor complex feedback loop that's interesting mean mechanic stabilized rapid gait good mechanic basically simplify locomotion extent disturb bit locomotion video instance exercise robot step robot fall surprise small perturbation expecting robot immediately fall sensor fast feedback loop mechanic stabilized gait robot doesn't fall make step bigger obstacle full control loop reflex what's important small perturbation mechanic important message biomechanics robotics neuroscience don't underestimate extent body help locomotion relate human locomotion human locomotion complex cat salamander locomotion time nervous system human similar vertebrate spinal cord key controller locomotion human that's there's lesion spinal cord dramatic effect person paraplegic tetraplegic brain loses communication spinal cord loses descending modulation initiate modulate locomotion big goal neuroprosthetics reactivate communication electrical chemical stimulation team world epfl colleague grégoire courtine silvestro micera collaborate properly it's important understand spinal cord work interacts body brain communicates spinal cord robot model i've presented today play key role important goal
