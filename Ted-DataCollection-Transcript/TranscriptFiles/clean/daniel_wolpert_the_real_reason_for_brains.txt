i'm neuroscientist neuroscience deal difficult question brain start easiest question question asked point life it's fundamental question understand brain function animal brain specie planet brain brain let's evolved reason perceive world that's completely wrong question length time it's blindingly obvious brain brain reason reason that's produce adaptable complex movement reason brain movement affecting world that's true there's that's sweating contraction muscle communication speech gesture writing sign language they're mediated contraction muscle it's important remember sensory memory cognitive process important they're important drive suppress future movement evolutionary advantage laying memory childhood perceiving color rose doesn't affect you're move life don't argument tree

cutting edge human performance i'm show emily fox winning world record cup stacking american audience cup stacking it's high school sport 12 cup stack unstack clock prescribed order world record real time she's pretty happy idea inside brain that's we'd group reverse engineer human control movement sound easy problem send command muscle contract arm body move sensory feedback vision skin muscle trouble signal beautiful signal thing make controlling movement difficult sensory feedback extremely noisy noise sound engineering neuroscience sense meaning random noise corrupting signal day digital radio tuning radio heard crrcckkk station wanted hear noise generally noise corrupts signal put hand table localize hand centimeter due noise sensory feedback similarly put motor output movement

great society place huge premium reduce consequence noise you're lucky knock small white ball hole hundred yard long metal stick society reward hundred million dollar convince brain lot effort reduce negative consequence sort noise variability i'm framework popular statistic machine learning 50 year called bayesian decision theory it's recently unifying brain deal uncertainty fundamental idea make inference action let's inference generate belief world belief belief arm space cat fox we're represent belief probability we're represent belief number meaning don't mean i'm absolutely number give gray level uncertainty key idea bayesian inference source information make inference data data neuroscience sensory input sensory input make belief there's source information that's effectively prior knowledge accumulate knowledge life memory point bayesian decision theory mathematics optimal combine prior knowledge sensory evidence generate belief i've put formula i'm explain formula it's beautiful real beauty real explanatory power estimate probability belief sensory input give intuitive imagine you're learning play tennis decide ball bounce net source information bayes' rule tell there's sensory evidence visual information auditory information it's land red spot sens perfect there's variability it's land shown cloud red representing number 0 5 0 1 information current shot there's source information current shot repeated experience game tennis that's ball doesn't bounce equal probability court match you're playing good opponent distribute green area prior distribution making hard return source information carry important information bayes' rule multiply number red number green number yellow ellipsis that's belief it's optimal combining information wouldn't wasn't year ago showed people learn movement skill mean bayesian inference machine learn statistic world lay learn noisy sensory apparatus combine real bayesian key part bayesian part formula part predict probability sensory feedback belief mean make prediction future convince brain make prediction sensory feedback it's profoundly perception i'll brain deal sensory input send command sensory feedback back transformation governed physic body sensory apparatus imagine inside brain here's inside brain predictor neural simulator physic body sens send movement command tap copy run neural simulator anticipate sensory consequence action shake ketchup bottle true sensory feedback function time bottom row i've good predictor predicts thing bother i'm feedback there's good reason imagine shake ketchup bottle kindly tap back extra source sensory information due external act source tapping shaking senses' point view combined source information there's good reason distinguish external event internal event external event behaviorally relevant feeling that's inside body reconstruct compare prediction based movement command reality discrepancy external world i'm making prediction subtracting left external evidence there's clear sensation generated feel generated person decided obvious place start tickling it's long time can't tickle people hasn't shown it's neural simulator simulating body subtracting sense bring experiment 21st century applying robotic technology problem effect sort stick hand attached robot they're move back forward we're track computer control robot tickle palm stick we're rate bunch thing including ticklishness i'll show part study i've robot basically people move arm sinusoidally back forward replay hand time delay time delay case light tickle palm time delay tenth tenth important point hand thing sinusoidal movement left hand put sinusoidal tickle we're playing tempo causality naught 0 1 ticklish 0 1 0 2 ticklish end 0 2 it's equivalently ticklish robot tickled responsible cancellation extremely tightly coupled tempo causality based illustration convinced field brain's making precise prediction subtracting sensation admit worst study
