human long held fascination human brain chart we've we've drawn we've mapped physical map world highly influenced technology google map gps thing happening brain mapping transformation let's brain people fresh human brain doesn't you're typically show brain typically you're fixed brain it's gray outer layer vasculature incredible human brain blood vessel 20 percent oxygen coming lung 20 percent blood pumped heart servicing organ that's basically hold fist it's slightly larger fist scientist sort end 20th century learned track blood flow map invasively activity human brain back part brain turning there's cerebellum that's keeping upright it's keeping standing it's involved coordinated movement side temporal cortex area primary auditory processing you're hearing word you're sending higher language processing center front brain place complex thought decision making it's mature late adulthood decision making process it's place you're deciding aren't order steak dinner deeper brain thing cross section can't lot structure there's lot structure it's cell it's wire wired hundred year ago scientist invented stain stain cell that's shown light blue area neuronal cell body stained it's uniform lot structure outer part brain neocortex it's continuous processing unit thing underneath blank area area wire running they're cell dense there's 86 billion neuron brain they're uniformly distributed they're distributed contributes underlying function mentioned start map brain function start tie individual cell let's deeper let's neuron mentioned 86 billion neuron smaller cell you'll support cell astrocyte glia nerve receiving input they're storing they're processing neuron connected synapsis 10 000 neuron brain neuron largely unique unique character individual neuron neuron collection brain driven fundamental property underlying biochemistry protein they're protein controlling thing ion channel movement they're controlling nervous system cell partner they're controlling basically nervous system zoom deeper level protein encoded genome 23 pair chromosome mom dad chromosome roughly 25 000 gene they're encoded dna nature cell driving underlying biochemistry dictated 25 000 gene turned level they're turned project seeking readout understanding 25 000 gene turned order undertake project brain lab technician seeking normal human brain start medical examiner's office place dead brought seeking normal human brain there's lot criterion we're selecting brain make normal human age 20 60 died natural death injury brain history psychiatric disease drug board toxicology workup we're careful brain we're selecting brain tissue consent tissue 24 hour time death we're measure rna readout gene labile move quickly side note collection brain collect require consent lot male brain female brain male die accidental death prime life men significant spouse give consent thing site collection collect what's called mr magnetic resonance imaging mri it's standard template we're hang rest data collect mr satellite view map thing collect what's called diffusion tensor imaging map large cabling brain mapping interstate highway brain removed skull it's sliced centimeter slice frozen solid they're shipped seattle seattle human hemisphere put what's basically glorified meat slicer there's blade that's cut section tissue transfer microscope slide we're apply stain scan mapping expert make basic anatomic assignment state boundary pretty broad outline we're fragment brain piece put smaller cryostat showing frozen tissue it's cut 20 micron thin baby hair's width remember it's frozen fashioned technology paintbrush applied microscope slide carefully melt slide robot that's apply stain anatomist deeper microscope collection configuration large small cell cluster place it's routine understand make assignment make basically what's reference atlas detailed map scientist back piece tissue what's called laser scanning microdissection technician take instruction scribe place laser cut blue dot cutting tissue fall microscope slide that's what's happening real time there's container underneath that's collecting tissue tissue purify rna basic technology put florescent tag tagged material put called microarray bunch dot individual dot unique piece human genome spotted glass roughly 60 000 element repeatedly measure gene 25 000 gene genome sample hybridize unique fingerprint quantitatively gene turned sample process brain we're taking thousand sample brain area shown area called hippocampus it's involved learning memory contributes 70 sample thousand sample sample 50 000 data point repeat measurement thousand sample roughly 50 million data point human brain we've human brain worth data we've put thing i'll show synthesis it's basically large data set information that's freely scientist world don't log tool mine data find interesting thing here's modality put you'll start recognize thing we've collected here's mr framework there's operator side turn zoom highlight individual structure importantly we're mapping anatomic framework common framework people understand gene turned red level gene turned great degree green sort cool area it's turned gene fingerprint remember we've assayed 25 000 gene genome data scientist learn data we're starting data there's basic thing understand great example drug prozac wellbutrin commonly prescribed antidepressant remember we're assaying gene gene send instruction make protein protein target drug drug bind protein turn understand action drug understand they're acting way way don't side effect profile gene turned time multiple individual we've assayed brain unique fingerprint confirmation confirmation gene turned prozac serotonergic structure thing affected thing area looked gene turned it's interesting side effect thing thing it's pattern matching exercise there's unique fingerprint scan entire genome find protein show similar fingerprint you're drug discovery entire listing genome offer find drug target optimize familiar genome wide association study form people covering news scientist recently discovered gene gene affect x kind study routinely published scientist they're great analyze large population entire genome find hot spot activity linked causally gene exercise simply list gene tell doesn't it's important researcher we've created resource start clue activity start common pathway thing simply haven't audience understand importance individuality human genetic background lived separate life fact genome greater 99 percent similar we're similar genetic level we're finding brain biochemical level similar show it's 99 percent it's roughly 90 percent correspondence reasonable cutoff cloud roughly correlated find outlier thing lie cloud gene interesting they're subtle it's important message home today celebrate difference similar brain level difference study follow difference they're subtle thing gene turned individual cell type gene found good example called reln it's involved early developmental cue disc1 gene that's deleted schizophrenia aren't schizophrenic individual show population variation you're donor donor exception gene turned specific subset cell it's dark purple precipitate cell that's telling gene turned that's due individual's genetic background experience don't kind study require larger population i'm leave final note complexity brain resource incredibly valuable give researcher handle looked handful individual point we're i'll close tool unexplored undiscovered continent frontier undaunted humbled complexity brain future awaits
