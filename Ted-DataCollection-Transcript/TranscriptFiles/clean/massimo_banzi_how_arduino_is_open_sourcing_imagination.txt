week ago friend mine gave toy car 8 year son store buying website downloaded file printed printer idea manufacture object digitally machine economist magazine defined industrial revolution argue revolution it's open source hardware maker's movement printer friend print toy open source website download file order make printer construction file hardware software instruction part large community thousand people world making kind printer there's lot innovation happening it's open source don't anybody's permission create great space personal computer 1976 apple company fighting year apple kind market there's interesting thing electronics open source heart printer i'm attached arduino board motherboard sort power printer project i've working past year it's open source project worked friend mine american italian spaniard it's worldwide project design institute called interaction design institute ivrea teaching interaction design idea design simple shape object move forward design interact thing design object that's supposed interact human make foam model mobile phone doesn't make sense interacts people worked arduino lot project create platform simple student student build thing worked don't year electronics engineer month make kid arduino kid sylvia make project arduino 11 year kid stop show stuff built arduino that's scary capability kid give tool let's make tool pick build quickly example sort kick discussion cat feeder gentleman made project cat sick healthy make ate proper food made thing recognizes cat chip mounted inside collar cat open door cat eat food made recycling cd player computer cardboard tape couple sensor blinking led suddenly tool build find market phrase scratch itch idea make equivalent sketching paper electronics feature important work hardware top made love italy back circuit it's open publish design file circuit online download make modify learn learning programming learned people's code people's circuit magazine good learn people's work element project open hardware released creative common license idea hardware piece culture share build song poem creative common software gpl it's open source documentation hand teaching methodology open source released creative common protected make people arduino isn't arduino made lot open source component individually hard 12 year kid arduino wrap mashup open source technology give user experience quickly situation people chile decided make board buying organize workshop save money company make variation arduino fit market there's 150 moment made company called adafruit run woman called limor fried ladyada hero open source hardware movement maker movement idea sort turbo charged diy community belief open source collaboration collaborates online collaborates space magazine called make sort gathered people sort put community technical project explained simple language beautifully typeset website instructables people teach arduino project page screen effectively learn make cake let's project quadcopter it's small model helicopter it's toy military technology year ago it's open source easy buy online diy drone community thing called arducopter launched start called matternet figured transport thing village africa fact easy find open source easy hack enabled prototype company quickly project matt richardson i'm sick hearing people tv decided arduino project call mute tv anytime exposed personality mentioned i'll show made mb check mr producer caught kim kardashian earlier today find planning wearing mb eh mr pretty good job protecting ear hear detail kim kardashian's wedding mb interesting matt found module let arduino process tv signal found code written generates infrared signal tv put created great project it's arduino's place large hadron collider there's arduino ball collecting data sort measuring parameter it's musical interface built student italy he's turning product student project product make assistive device glove understands sign language transforms gesture make sound writes word you're signing display made part find website sell arduino compatible part assemble project project itp part nyu met boy severe disability play ps3 built device kid play baseball limited movement capability find art project txtbomber put message device roll wall basically solenoid pressing button spray can pull wall writes wall political message yeah plant called botanicalls there's arduino ball wi fi module plant it's measuring plant it's creating twitter account interact plant plant start hot there's lot water personality plant twitter baby inside belly pregnant woman kick 14 year kid chile made system detects earthquake publishes twitter 280 000 follower he's 14 anticipated governmental project year project analyzing twitter feed family basically point harry potter movie find project website made chair twitter fart it's interesting 2009 gizmodo basically defined project meaning twitter lot changed project fukushima disaster happened bunch people japan realized information government giving wasn't open reliable built geiger counter arduino network interface made 100 gave people japan essentially data gathered published website called cosm website built reliable real time information field unbiased information machine it's diy bio movement it's step order process dna it's completely open source ground student developing country making replica scientific instrument cost lot money make build lot arduino part ph probe kid kid they're spain learned program make robot 11 started arduino make robot play football world champion making arduino based robot make educational robot design needed make great robot excites kid i'm guy supposed excite huh term educational asset there's company google technology create interface mobile phone tablet real world accessory development kit google open source based arduino opposed apple closed source nda sign life apple there's giant maze joey's sitting maze moving tilt tablet italy design important italy conservative worked design studio called habit milan make mirror completely open source double ipod speaker idea hardware software design object fabrication project open source make designer pick learn make great device learn make interactive product starting real idea idea there's thousand idea hour presentation hour let's start group people started company called pebble prototyped watch communicates bluetooth phone display information prototyped lcd screen nokia mobile phone arduino final project kickstarter 100 000 dollar make sell 10 million dollar completely fully funded start don't vcs involved excite people great project project show it's called ardusat it's kickstarter contribute it's satellite space open source thing imagine arduino connected bunch sensor arduino upload experiment satellite run imagine high school satellite week satellite space experiment there's lot example i'm stop arduino community day making lot project community chris anderson massimo told earlier today idea mb ca feel read stuff you've unlocked mb it's work lot people community enabling people make great stuff feel overwhelmed it's it's difficult describe morning wake stuff google alert sends it's amazing it's field imagine ca
