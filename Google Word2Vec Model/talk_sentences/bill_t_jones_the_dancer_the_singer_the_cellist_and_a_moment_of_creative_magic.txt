 Isadora Duncan -- (Music) -- crazy, long-legged woman from San Francisco, got tired of this country, and she wanted to get out. Isadora was famous somewhere around 1908 for putting up a blue curtain, and she would stand with her hands over her solar plexus and she would wait, and she would wait, and then, she would move. (Music) Josh and I and Somi call this piece "The Red Circle and the Blue Curtain." Red circle. Blue curtain. But, this is not the beginning of the 20th century. This is a morning in Vancouver in 2015. (Music) (Singing) Come on, Josh! (Music) (Singing) Go! Are we there yet? I don't think so. Hey, yeah! (Music) What time is it? (Music) Where are we? Josh. Somi. Bill T. Josh. Somi. Bill T. (Applause) Yeah, yeah!
