 (Music) I went down to St. James Infirmary To see my baby there She was lying on a long wooden table So cold, so still, so fair I went up to see the doctor "She's very low," he said I went back to see my baby Good God she's lying there dead I went down to old Joe's bar room On the corner of the square They were serving drinks as per usual And the usual crowd was there To my left stood Old Joe McKennedy His eyes were bloodshot red He turned to the crowd around him And these are the words he said "Let her go, let her go, God bless her Wherever she may be She can search this whole wide world all over But she'll never find another man like me She can search this whole wide world all over And she'll never find another man like me When I die, please God, bury me In my ten-dollar Stetson hat Put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain So my friends know I died standing pat Get six gamblers to carry my coffin And six choir girls to sing me a song Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon To raise hell as I go along Now that's the end of my story Let's have another round of booze And if anyone should ask you Just tell them I got the St. James Infirmary blues (Applause)
